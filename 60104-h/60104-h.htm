<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p><i>The observations and reflections contained in the following pages, are
the results of several autumnal excursions in the line of the German
Spas, undertaken partly for health, partly for recreation, and partly
for information on a subject that now interests a large portion of English
invalids. The contents of the volume are like the objects which gave
it origin. They are miscellaneous—and probably this character will be objected
to, on the principle, “ne sutor ultra crepidam.” I have yet to learn,
however, why a physician should be debarred from indulgence in general
observations or reflections, and confined exclusively to professional topics.
His education, habits of thought, and knowledge of human nature do not
particularly disqualify him for a task which is daily undertaken by people of
all grades of acquirement, and degrees of ability. The truth is, that being
too independent to write for the mere purpose of catching the approbation of
others, I have followed the bent of my own inclinations, and, if taken to task
by censors, have little other reason to offer for my conduct than the old
one—“stat pro ratione voluntas.”</i></p>

<p><i>There is one portion of the book, however, (a very small one, some twenty
pages of letter-press) which may require some apology. The course of the
Rhine leads to most of the German Spas, and is therefore traversed annually
by multitudes of invalids as well as tourists. Every castle and promontory on
its banks has its legend, and these traditions contribute to fix the picture of
the locality in the mind’s eye, by association, for ever afterwards. In one of
my excursions, some years ago, it struck me that these legends were <span class="antiqua">designed</span>,
originally, each to convey some moral precept—at all events, I became convinced
that they were <span class="antiqua">capable</span> of being <span class="antiqua">moralized</span>. Under this impression,
I condensed the principal traditionary tales that have their <span class="antiqua">locale</span> in sight of
the voyager, and deduced what I considered to be the moral or useful precepts
which they concealed under a wild and improbable fiction. If I have failed
in this attempt, the intention, at least, was good. Throughout the whole
volume, my object has been to compress into small space much useful information
for invalid or tourist, and, on all occasions, to start subjects for
meditation or reflection, well knowing, from long experience, that such occupations
of the mind on a journey, are eminently conducive both to pleasure
and health.</i></p>

<p><i>In the principal or professional portion of the work, I have endeavoured to
collect all the information in my power, and, in the exercise of my judgment,
to sift the grain from the chaff, thus to steer clear of the extremes of
exaggeration and scepticism. There has been too much of the <span class="antiqua">former</span> abroad,
and too much of the <span class="antiqua">latter</span> at home. Holding myself perfectly free from all
obligation to subserve local interests on one side of the channel, or foster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span>
national prejudices on the other, I have spoken my mind, with equal fearlessness
and, I hope, impartiality.</i></p>

<p><i>The typography of this volume will prove that, although I must plead
guilty to the charge of “making a book,” it has not been constructed on the
approved principles of “<span class="smcap">book making</span>.” By certain mechanical processes
well known “in the trade,” this slender tome might have been easily expanded
into two or even three goodly, or at least costly octavos, without the expenditure
of a single additional line, word, or thought. But, bearing in mind the old
Greek maxim that “a great book is a great evil,” I was determined that,
should my lucubrations come under this head at all, the evil as well as the
book should be on a small scale. Spa-going invalids have evils enough, God
knows, to carry on their shoulders, without the addition, of a “<span class="smcap">Mega Biblion</span>”
in their wallets.</i></p>

<p><i>There is one defect in this work, however, which common honesty compels
me to point out to the intending purchaser, before he parts with his money. If
the travelling invalid expects to find here a catalogue of the post-houses, the
signs of the inns, the prices of the wines, the fares of the table-d’hôtes,
the pretensions of the cuisine, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c., except upon very rare occasions,
he will be woefully disappointed. All this species of information, and a great
deal more, will be found in that excellent emporium of peripatetic lore—“<span class="smcap">Murray’s
Handbook</span>.” But even this useful feature in the “red-book,”
is not without its alloy. The character of caravanserais is perpetually
changing, as well as that of their landlords; and when one of these gets a
good name in a guide book, the afflux of travellers to that point too often causes
the master to become proud, the servants lazy, the fare bad, and the bill
exorbitant. Many a bitter anathema have I heard launched against the
“Handbooks, &amp;c.” for leading tourists and invalids to be starved and fleeced
at the “<span class="smcap">Red Lion</span>,” when they might have fared sumptuously and cheaply at
the “<span class="smcap">Black Swan</span>.”</i></p>

<p><i>Still, the Handbook is equally invaluable and indispensable to the continental
traveller; and, as far as the Spas are concerned, Dr. Granville’s work is full
of information on this subject. The profession and the public, indeed, are
deeply indebted to Dr. Granville and Mr. Edwin Lee for opening out wider
and clearer views of the continental mineral waters; but the subject itself,
so far from being exhausted, is only in its infancy of investigation. Whether
we regard the constituent elements of the waters themselves, their physiological
operation, or their remedial efficacy, there is ample room for many future
inquirers.</i></p>

<p><i>I have now only to return my sincere thanks to the various German and
other physicians on the continent, from whom I received oral, written, or published
information, and to say that I shall feel myself honoured by any future
communications from the same sources, on the subject of the Spas.</i></p>

<h1>PILGRIMAGES TO THE SPAS.</h1>

<h2 id="First_Pilgrimage">(First Pilgrimage.)</h2>

<p>Many tribes of the great <span class="smcap">John Bull</span> family appear, of late years, to have
abjured “red port” and “brown stout,” in favour of several breweries on
the Continent, and especially in Germany. These breweries are deeply
seated in the bowels of the Earth, and the art and mystery of their brewings
are far beyond the sight and cognizance of man. Whether cocculus
Indicus, logwood, sloe-juice, or opium enter into their gigantic vats and
boiling cauldrons, it is hard to say; but, however manufactured, they are
thrown up on the surface of our globe, <i>pro bono publico</i>—greatly to the
detriment of doctors, druggists, and apothecaries, in this and in many
other countries.</p>

<p>The subterranean distilleries are conducted on the homœopathic principle—viz.
that of employing the minutest quantities of active materials—probably
in order to do the least possible harm. They have many and
great advantages over the homœopathic laboratories. They diffuse their
ingredients through such immense potions of water, that, to get at a few
grains of the <i>former</i>, we are obliged to ingurgitate some quarts of the
<i>latter</i>. Now the mere mechanical flow of such prodigious doses of fluid
through the various outlets—the bowels, kidneys, skin, &amp;c. must sweep
away morbid secretions, and contribute to the breaking down of obstructions
in different organs, independently of the medicinal agents that are
diffused through the mass of liquids in the greatest possible state of division
and solution—circumstances which enable them to permeate and
penetrate through innumerable capillary tubes and complicated glandular
apparatuses, where grosser materials could never reach.</p>

<p>The natural fountains of Hygeia, however, have other advantages and
auxiliaries, of which the laboratory of the chemist, and the pharmacy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the practitioner are deprived. <span class="smcap">Hope</span> itself, though often resting on fallacious
and exaggerated histories of cures, contributes much to the accomplishment
of even marvellous recoveries. The severing, or even relaxing
of that chain which binds care round the human heart, and augments the
sufferings and the progress of disease, is no mean ally of the spa. It is
true indeed, that the “splendid misery” of the great, and the corroding
grief of the exile, cannot be thrown off by change of climate—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Scandit æratas vitiosa naves</div>
<div class="verse">Cura—quid terras, alio calentes</div>
<div class="verse">Sole, mutamus—patriæ quis exul</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But the valetudinarian in pursuit of health, is somewhat differently circumstanced.
The change of scene and air—of food and drink—of rising
and retiring—of exercise and conversation—in short, of the whole moral
and physical conditions around him, effect, in many cases, such a mental
and corporeal improvement, as makes easy work for the mineral waters—especially
when the extreme dilution of their contents is taken into
consideration.</p>

<p>Let it not be supposed, however, that this picture is without any reverse.
Many diseases—especially organic ones—are aggravated by the journey to
a distant spa—by the imprudent use of the water—by the warm or hot
bathing—by the enthusiasm or rather <span class="smcap">hydromania</span>, of the spa-doctor,
who, having little acquaintance with the constitution of the patient, extols
his favourite spring, and recommends it in almost every complaint. To
separate probabilities from improbabilities, and impossibilities from both,
will be attempted occasionally in the following pages, as we pass in review
some of the principal resorts of invalids on both sides of the Rhine.</p>

<h4>THE STEAMER.</h4>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Batavier</span>, all humps and hollows—the reverse of what one would
expect in anything <i>Batavian</i>—and as ugly a black whale as ever floundered
through an Arctic Ocean, received an ample cargo on the 3rd. of
August 183—. I shall not attempt to minutely analyse such a numerous
as well as motley group, on the short acquaintance of twenty-six
hours. It was pretty evident, however, that we had on board representatives
of various classes of society—more especially of the arts, sciences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and professions. The lawyer had left his clients to live in peace—the
doctor had left his patients to die in peace:—and the pastor had committed
his flock to some vicarious shepherd. The merchant had handed his
ledger, and the banker his money-shovel to their clerks—and it seemed
as though half the shopocracy had left their counters in care of the
shopmen.</p>

<p>All was bustle and confusion among the steamers starting for various
destinations—and I verily believe that the inhabitants of Pompeii did not
rush in greater haste or in greater numbers to the sea, when chased by
the ashes and lava of Vesuvius, than did the inhabitants of the metropolis
to the banks of the Thames on this beautiful morning! There were to be
seen <span class="smcap">senators</span>, who had patriotically injured their own constitutions while
reforming that of their country—<span class="smcap">tailors</span> from Bond Street, going to Vienna
and Athens to measure the “Corinthian pillars of the state,” on the philosophical
principles of Laputa—aldermen from Bucklersbury, to exude a
portion of green fat and callipash in the valleys of Switzerland—geological
chemists, with hammers, bags, and blow-pipes, bound for the mountains
of <span class="smcap">Taunus</span> to ascertain the age of <span class="smcap">Mother Earth</span>, by means of the fish-bones,
oyster-shells, and pebbles, which she had swallowed at some of her
grand suppers—antiquarians journeying to the Roman forum to disinter the
bones of M. Curtius and his horse, which had lain so long in their marble
cerements—engineers from a new joint-stock company to survey a line of
rail-road over the Great St. Bernard—candidates for the Traveller’s Club,
going to <i>qualify</i> by crossing some pons asinorum over the Danube—tourists
of all calibres; some to make a tour simply; some to write a tour badly;
but the greater number to talk of a tour afterwards—<span class="smcap">nabobs</span> from the
East; some with the complexion of a star pagoda; some as pallid as a
sicca rupee; and others as blue as Asiatic cholera—<span class="smcap">Cantabs</span>, with their
tutors, going to study spherics among the Alps of Oberland—<span class="smcap">Oxonians</span>,
to collate Greek and gibberish among the Ionian Isles—<span class="smcap">Missionaries</span>
from Paternoster-row and Albemarle-street, to convert foolscap into food
for circulating libraries, and the “bitter wassers” of Germany into Burgundy
and Champaigne for themselves—<span class="smcap">Conservatives</span> flying from the
“West-end,” to preserve the remnants of a shattered constitution—<span class="smcap">landlords</span>
from Green Erin going to spend their rack-rents in the fashionable
saloons of Baden Baden—<span class="smcap">roué’s</span> from St. James’s, repairing, as a
forlorn hope, to the Cur-saals (anglice, <span class="smcap">Cursed Hells</span>) of Nassau and
Bavaria—<span class="smcap">bacchanals</span>, <span class="smcap">debauchees</span>, and <span class="smcap">gourmands</span>, hastening to Kissengen
and Carlsbad, in hopes of restoring their jaded appetites and
reducing their tumid livers—<span class="smcap">Judges</span> from Westminster, who, in all actions
of “<span class="smcap">Rus</span> <i>versus</i> <span class="smcap">Urbem</span>,” had lately determined in favour of the
plaintiff, without reference to the jury—<span class="smcap">Bishops</span>, who had left their black
aprons on the Banks of the Thames, to have a peep at the lady with
scarlet petticoats on the banks of the Tyber—aspiring youths of enlarged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
views and high pretensions, determined to see the world from the summit
of Mont Blanc—<span class="smcap">pallid beauties</span>, from Portman Square, with their
anxious mammas, bound to Ems and Schwalbach, in hopes of transmuting
their lillies into roses, by exchanging the midnight waltz for the “mittag”
meal, and fiery port for the sparkling “wein-brunnen”—faded belles and
shattered beaux, of certain and uncertain ages, repairing to Schlangenbad,
for satin surfaces and renewal of youth. We had members of both houses
who had inhaled sulphuretted hydrogen gas to such an extent, in St.
Stephens, during the session, as to cause violent explosions of malodorous
philippics, to the great annoyance of their opposite neighbours:—these
were on their way to the Alps for pure air before the next eruption. Here
were seen veterans from the “United Service,” whose memories had survived
their hopes, bound on a pilgrimage to Waterloo and Camperdown,
to heave a last sigh over the setting sun of martial glory, and the degenerate
æra of insipid peace. Here were whigs, tories, radicals and revolutionists;
together with men of high church, low church, and no church
doctrines, but all (incredible to relate) unanimously agreed on one principle,
that of the “<i>mouvement</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>These and hundreds, not to say thousands of others, whose avocations,
objects, and pursuits were only known to themselves—</p>

<p>But to return to the Batavier. Honour to the man who first applied
steam to locomotion. His ingenuity has enabled him to distil from water
a light vapour which conquers the ocean from whence it sprang. It more
than half diminishes the terror of the sea and the miseries of the voyage.
It brings Lisbon and Gibraltar within the same distance of London as
Edinburgh used to be. Though lighter than the air we breathe, it can
resist the impetuosity of the heaviest storm, and stem the torrent of the
most rapid river. It has nearly broken the trident of Neptune, and owns
little allegiance to his sceptre. Steam may now say to the watery god,
what the ocean monarch once said to a brother deity—</p>

<p>Æolus may unchain the winds—Boreas may bluster, and Auster may
weep; but steam heeds them not. Resistance only lends it strength, and
oppression elasticity. The offspring of eternal and implacable enemies
(fire and water), its birth is invariably and necessarily fatal to its parents.
The new Being thus generated is as gigantic in power as it is transitory in
existence. Imprisoned for a moment, it bursts its barriers—regains its
liberty—and dies! But these struggles for freedom work the iron wings
that impel the monster steamer through the briny waves. Deep in the
womb of this moving volcano, we see the fires of Ætna glowing—cauldrons
boiling—pumps playing—chains clanking—Ixion’s wheels incessantly revolving—steam
roaring—and volumes of smoke belched upwards, to
darken the skies with artificial clouds. Could some of our forefathers rise
from their graves, and behold a steamer flying over the waves against wind
and tide, and without oar or sail, they would be not a little astonished,
and curious enough to know the name of the planet to which they had
been wafted after leaving their native earth.</p>

<h4>THE SEA.</h4>

<p>Campbell, our immortal poet, has dedicated an amatory epistle to the
sea, descriptive of her various charms. When in good humour, no lady
has a smoother face, or a more smiling countenance, and she then well
deserves the title of “mirror of the stars,” which the bard has gallantly
conferred on her. But when ruffled in temper, she is one of the veriest
termagants I have ever encountered. She will then fret and foam—aye,
and proceed from words to blows, knocking about her friends and her foes,
like stock-fish.</p>

<p>Many have been the philtres and objurgations proposed for securing her
“crispid smiles,” and obviating her “luxurious heavings;” but few of
them are of any value. I have found it best to lie down, bandage my
eyes, and let the angry Goddess have her own way. In the present
instance her marine majesty was in a singularly mild mood, during the
passage. A nautilus might have spread his sail and gone to sleep in
safety. We approached the low sand hills concealing a still lower surface
of country—struck on the Brill—and after two or three rolls, the Batavier
tumbled like a whale into the Maas. We were soon abreast of Schiedam,
whence volumes of smoke and vapour redolent of gin were wafted over us
by the northern breeze, while a hundred windmills were whirling round
as far as the eye could reach. It is curious that in Holland, the most
watery country in the world, grain is ground by means of wind; while in
Switzerland, the most windy country in Europe, corn is ground by means
of water. A moment’s reflection clears up the paradox. In Holland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
water sleeps during seven days in the week, unmolested, save by the occasional
crawling of the trackschuyt:—in Switzerland, every stream leaps
joyously from rock to rock, grinding the corn, washing the linen, spinning
the flax, turning the lathes, and performing a hundred domestic services.</p>

<h4>ROTTERDAM.</h4>

<p>In a few hours after passing the Brill, we arrived at the most bustling
and thriving town in Holland. A protracted line of shipping, receiving
and discharging their cargoes—an even jetty or quay, planted with majestic
trees—and a long row of noble-looking houses facing the river, preclude
all view of Rotterdam. It is impossible to get a prospect of any Dutch
town except from its highest steeple. Immediately, as is my custom, I
ascended the spire of St. Lawrence’s cathedral, and there enjoyed a magnificent
coup-d’œil of the fine sea-port, and the adjacent country, as far as
the Hague. Each street is a kind of duplicate (double portrait) of the
quay: the centre of almost every one being Macadamized, not with granite
or gravel, but with the masts, yards, decks, and high bugger-luggs of
ships. This species of Macadamization not being the most convenient for
carriages or pedestrians, the broad trottoirs on each side, roughly paved
and thickly planted, serve for all kinds of viators, and must give ample
encouragement to corn-cutters, blacksmiths, veterinary surgeons, and
coach-builders.</p>

<p>Nine-tenths of the houses present their gable-ends to the street—a high
flight of steps leading to the hall—and a coach door at the side, leading to
the court. Each mansion (where there is not an open shop) is a merchant’s
castle, flanked with warehouses filled with goods, neatly furnished, and
kept remarkably clean. The inhabitants differ from those of an English
town much less than the inhabitants of any other continental city. The
women are far more fair and handsome than either the French, Germans,
or Italians—and the word “<span class="smcap">comfort</span>,” unintelligible in any language but
our own, is practically legible in every street of Rotterdam.</p>

<p>I made my bow to the statue of Erasmus, though the name called up
some scholastic recollections, not of the most pleasant kind, as connected
with his Naufragium: after which, we perambulated this city of “ships,
colonies, and commerce,” till a late hour in the evening.</p>

<p>From the moment that John Bull first sets foot on any part of the Continent
between Scandinavia and Cape Coast Castle, he begins to pay daily
the penalty of early-acquired and long-continued bad habits. But this is
not all. Some of his good habits stand in the way of his comfort and
health. The sooner he makes up his mind to the change, the better. And
first, of sleep. If he means to enjoy the blessings of “tired Nature’s
sweet restorer,” he must repair to his chamber as soon as possible after the
sun has taken his evening bath in the Atlantic. And he should spring
from his couch before, rather than after, Apollo pleases to—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Rise refulgent from Tithonus’ bed.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In most of the continental towns, the streets are as silent as those of
Pompeii after ten o’clock; but the bustle begins at day-light, and he must
have taken a strong dose of opium who can sleep after that hour! The
cocks are crowing, the carts are clattering, the waiters are knocking up
the travellers going off by diligence or steamer, the travellers themselves
are bawling out for “eau chaude,” “warm wasser,” “boots,” “coffee,”
or the “billet”—in short, the jargon of different languages resounding
through the lobbies for an hour or two after day-light, would put Babel to
shame. And last, not least, the eternal ding-dong of bells, especially in
Catholic countries, from dawn of day till eight o’clock, might convince the
most sceptical Protestant that <span class="smcap">purgatory</span> is no fable, but an actual punishment
inflicted by the priests on this side of the grave, as a foretaste of
the future!</p>

<p>Still, in most of the continental towns, there is an interval of five or
six hours in the night, during which the wearied limbs of the traveller
may rest, and his ears may be relieved from discordant sounds. Not so at
Rotterdam. The night is infinitely more noisy than the day. It is then
that the real bustle begins at the <span class="smcap">Hotel des Pays Bas</span>, and along the
whole line of the quay. The absence of light appears to operate on this
amphibious race in the same way as it does on frogs, bats, and owls, and
various animals addicted to nocturnal depredation. By midnight the sailors
of different nations begin to get sober for the second or third time since
morning, and the work of loading and unloading, craning and carting, &amp;c.
begins in good earnest. The eternal chorus of “<i>yo heave ho</i>,” from a
thousand throats, o’ertopping, but not drowning the boisterous din of unutterable
discord on all sides, would rouse the god of sleep from his bed
of ebony, and put his prime minister, Morpheus, to flight.</p>

<p>How the Rotterdamers preserve their lives in the midst of stagnant
water surrounding and pervading every habitation, and ingurgitated by
man, woman, and child, is only explicable on one of two principles—perhaps
of both. They are accustomed to it, as the eels are to skinning:—or
the neighbouring <span class="smcap">Scheidam</span> poisons the animalculæ, and prevents their
poisoning the people. There is yet one other supposition. In every
habitation and chamber of Rotterdam, and indeed of Holland, there is
very perceptible to the senses a malodorous effluvium, composed of three
different gases, and emanating from gin, peat and tobacco. This “tertium
<i>quid</i>”—this “tria juncta in uno”—may possibly tend to counteract,
or, at all events, to cover the malarious exhalations continually rising from
a quiescent pool, into which the <i>debris</i> of all utterable and <i>unutterable</i>
things are daily and nightly plunged!<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE HAGUE.</h4>

<p>I have long been tired of rambling through museums and picture-galleries—churches
and palaces—gardens and promenades; but I am absolutely
sick of the endless and reiterated descriptions of all these and a
thousand other things, which every tourist delineates anew, as if he had
been the first visitor that ever saw the lions!</p>

<p>In these catalogues there can be nothing new, even to the fire-side
traveller, and I shall pass them by, with merely an occasional reflection or
remark. I find but one or two notes in my diary of the Hague—one, the
record of a most capital BULL—not made by an Irishman, but by a Dutchman—the
“<span class="smcap">Jeune Taureau</span>,” by Paul Potter. This sturdy, stiff-necked,
sandy-haired representative of my countrymen, is no bad sample of the
breed. I wish a certain animal of this species, which stands in Fleet
Street, with a mouth wide open, and greedy for all kinds of provender,
were to be brushed up a little, <i>a la Paul Potter</i>. I am sure it would increase
the number of spectators, if not of subscribers, to our witty, keen,
and sarcastic hebdomadal of Temple-bar.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>At the dull aristocratic and academic town of Leyden, we crossed a sad
memorial of fallen greatness—the drivelling descendant of the majestic
Rhine, reduced to the dimensions of a canal, and, like the degenerate
offspring of some renowned hero, disgracing the line of his noble ancestor!
Restive and perverse in its last act, it only <i>flows</i> when the tide <i>ebbs</i>, and
stands motionless during the flood. Leyden being a university “open to
all parties,” and influenced by merit only (with a little gold), it imposes no
oath on the candidates for its degrees—whatever may be the creed of the
aspirant.</p>

<h4>HAERLEM.</h4>

<p>This is a phrenological city, distinguished by a remarkable bump—the
largest “organ of music” in the world. But there is a greater lion in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Haerlem than the great organ—one whose distant roarings have struck
more terror into the heart of John Bull than did ever Napoleon, with his
legions at Boulogne. This monstrous birth of the French revolution—this
offspring of atheism and education, in which the orthodox light is
extinguished—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">is neither more nor less than a “<span class="smcap">normal school</span>.” As this term is not in
Johnson’s Dictionary, it is inferred by our home oracles, that it exists not
in any language, ancient or modern. As I cannot give its derivation, I
shall try at its definition. It is a school where “<i>boys and girls are taught
the rudiments of knowledge without wrangling about creeds</i>.” It is alike
open to the Jew and the Gentile, the Protestant and Catholic, the Baptist
and Anabaptist, the Unitarian and Trinitarian. Now as each of these
sects holds its own theology to be the true orthodox one, I do not see
how any <i>one form</i> of religious instruction can be combined with elementary
education. We might as well try to force the same note on all the
inmates of a menagerie, as the same creed on all the elèves of a normal
school. And, after all, why should theology be taken out of the hands of
the pastor, to be put into those of the pedagogue? May not letters be
taught without a Liturgy—and cyphering without a Catechism? We see
that, in two of the most Protestant countries—Prussia and Holland—the
system works well, at least peaceably. The children of various sects can
learn to read without ridiculing, and to write without stigmatizing each
other’s creeds. They live in peace while acquiring the rudiments of human
knowledge at school—and they repair to the chapels or synagogues of
their parents to hear the word of God, where it is most properly delivered.
A youthful harmony or even friendship is thus generated among all persuasions,
and is never afterwards entirely obliterated.</p>

<p>But I imagine that an unnecessary dread of this “tree of knowledge,”
whose mortal fruit—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Brought death into the world and all our woe,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">is entertained by the good people of England. Reading, writing, and
arithmetic do not constitute knowledge, but merely the machinery by
which it may be afterwards acquired. These rudiments are, like the types
of the printer distributed in their compartments—void of learning or
science in themselves, till they are worked up by the compositor—who,
himself is only an instrument in the hands of a higher agent. “The
instruction given in the schools (says an excellent observer, Mr. Chambers)
is deficient of nearly all that bears on the cultivation of the perceptive
and reflective faculties, and consequently the expansion of the
intellect.” This education rarely extends beyond reading, writing, arithmetic,
and geography—while the superior orders are taught the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
language. At or under 14 years of age, the child leaves school and
merges on the ordinary avocations of life. There is in Holland nearly a
total absence of scientific instruction. Words not things are taught, and
no taste is generated for literature. Yet this elementary education at
school, and religious instruction at home, have rendered the people remarkable
for order, piety, and morality. In no other country is there so
little crime or squalid poverty.</p>

<p>I wish I could say as much for civil as for religious liberty in this
country. The press is more completely muzzled than any cart-dog in
London. The latter may open his jaws so far as to growl; but the press
is hermetically sealed in this submarine territory. No book can be translated
or published without the censor’s license—nay, a hand-bill, announcing
the importation of Warren’s blacking or Morrison’s pills, cannot
be printed or affixed to a wall, without a license and a stamp! In a conversation
with an intelligent Dutchman respecting this restriction on the
press, I was completely silenced by the following argument. I believe,
said the gentleman, that in your profession, <i>prevention</i> is considered to be
better than cure. I assented. Then, said he, I observe in all your newspapers
that people are tried, and sometimes severely punished, for publishing
libels, although the authors may not believe them to be such at
the time of writing them. Now the paternal Government of Holland
<i>prevents</i> such misfortunes and evils from happening to its subjects, by
examining the document before publication, and thus taking on itself the
responsibility, in case it should turn out afterwards to be libellous. There
was no answering this argument. The Dutch are the most patient animals
that ever lived beneath a yoke, or bowed beneath a load of taxes.
Talk of John Bull’s rates and taxes! They are bagatelles compared to
those in Holland! Every species of business, from the cobbler to the ship-builder,
is taxed after a graduated scale, varying from a few shillings to
twenty or thirty pounds annually. Every dwelling, every window, door,
fireplace—even the furniture, is taxed according to its value! The taxes
on houses are more than a fourth of the rent! The necessaries of life are,
in fact, extremely dear, and were it not for the solace of tobacco, gin, and
coffee, the poorer classes of Dutchmen would die in their dykes under the
pressure of hunger and taxation, notwithstanding their loyalty to <span class="smcap">King</span>,
and love of <span class="smcap">Vaderland</span>!</p>

<h4>AMSTERDAM.</h4>

<p>How often does the monotonized traveller in Holland and Belgium sigh
for the luxury of a zig-zag mule-track along the steep acclivity of some
alpine height, as a change of scene from the eternal right-lined chaussée,
terminating out of sight, beyond the verge of the horizon, or dipping apparently,
like Pharaoh’s route, into a lake or the ocean! The Haerlem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
pavé is constantly menaced by the Zuyder-Zee on the right, and the
German Ocean on the left; but it escapes a watery grave, and safely
lands the weary tourist in Amsterdam. Ascending the tower of the
Stadthouse, or palace, I cast my wondering eyes over the largest community
of beavers that ever lived upon logs, or drove their far-fetched
piles into the muddy bottom of lake or pool! Strange that the dry land
of this our globe should not afford space enough for cities or towns, without
invading the Adriatic and the Zuyder-Zee for the sites of Venice and
Amsterdam! From this bird’s-eye view, the confusion and commixture
of land and water is inextricable and incalculable. The city stands on
nearly one hundred detached islets, connected by more than three times
that number of drawbridges—the houses rising bolt upright out of the
water—each street being a quay lined with trees—and each mansion a
warehouse, as evinced by the crane and rope at the attic for hoisting in
goods, furniture, fuel, and provisions. The space between the houses and
the water, is much narrower than at Rotterdam, and I think the bustle
and activity of commerce are far less conspicuous in the northern than
in the southern entrepôt. The water, though capable of floating ships,
is unfit for cooking or drinking—and, were it not for the springs of
Seltzer, and the distilleries of Scheidam, I imagine that hydrophobia
would universally prevail.</p>

<p>I suspect that the Amsterdammers were originally a colony from Palestine.
Like the “chosen people,” they are much fonder of conveying
merchandize from one hand to another, than of manufacturing any article
of trade or commerce. The only fabrications that I could see, were those
of ships to carry, and houses to contain goods. The building of houses
has long been limited to the re-construction of those whose foundations
had given way—and naval architecture has received many checks—the
annihilation of the whale-fishery among others. But the red-herring still
cheers the heart of the Hollander, and qualifies the brackish water of the
Zuyder-Zee. While wandering through the streets in the evening, I
found that gin-palaces were not confined to England. They are on a
splendid scale here, and frequented by better classes of society than in the
British metropolis. We saw burgesses—probably burgomasters—with
their wives, and sometimes with their children, drinking, smoking, and
listening to the dulcet sounds of Swiss or Bavarian hurdi-gurdies. This
was not quite in keeping with the grave, moral, and religious character of
the Dutchman.</p>

<p>It is not my inclination—to say the truth, it is not my forte—to describe
the lions of Amsterdam—or of any of the other dams in this hybrid
offspring of land and water. It was quite enough for me to see the
shows—their pictorial delineation I leave to those of my tourist brethren
who have studied under that inimitable painter, and hero of the hammer,
Geo. Robins, Esq. They can readily transmute a varnished treckschuyt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
into a Cleopatra’s barge—a buggerlugg into a bust of bronze—a Flanders
mare into a prancing Bucephalus—a brick trottoir into a tesselated pavement—or
a Belgian flat into a garden of the Hesperides. The worst of
this is, that, by the time they have ascended the Rhine, or entered Switzerland,
their stock of the picturesque is expended, and they have only the
sublime to draw upon for the remainder of the tour.</p>

<p>To see the sights of Amsterdam, the gilders and stivers must be in perpetual
motion. Even at the doors of the churches, the padré’s demand
your money for admittance into their cold, damp, and dreary tabernacles—a
most unusual practice on the Continent.</p>

<p>In order to vary the journey, we returned by Utrecht to Rotterdam:—but
although the route was <i>alter</i>, the scene was <i>idem</i>—and I will not
detain the reader with any account of it.</p>

<h4>BATAVIAN CHARACTERISTICS.</h4>

<p>Of all the geological ups and downs which the surface of this globe
presents, none is more remarkable, or less remarked, than that which the
land of Holland has undergone. Every particle of its soil must once
have occupied some higher land or even mountain of the Continent, before
it travelled down to take its bath in the ocean—ultimately to rise to
nearly the level of the sea—then to be rescued from the waters, partly by
the operations of Nature, and partly by the industry of man. Even now
the mighty Alps are daily crumbling down, and every shower of rain,
and mountain torrent washes down its quota of soil to the Mediterranean
or the German Ocean.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Should no volcanic revolution interrupt these
watery changes, a period must come—ten thousand years are but a dot in
the stream of time—when the high lands will be worn down into alluvial
deposits which, rising from their oceanic beds, will become annexations to
the existing plains. The lower heights will of course shew the effects
of this “wear and tear” sooner than the snow-clad Alps; but even these
last must one day undergo that transmutation and transplantation to
which all sublunary things are destined. This is no imaginary speculation.
It is not in Holland alone that we see vast tracts of land carried
down from the hills—buried in the deep, for a time—and afterwards
rescued from their watery beds. The Delta of the Nile was once among
the mountains of Abyssinia—the Sunderbunds have spread far and wide to
the south of Calcutta, dividing the Ganges into a hundred mouths—extending
the land into the bay of Bengal, and sustaining myriads of
animals, and even man himself—the Mississippi and the St. Lawrence
are digging the grave of the Alligagny mountains—the mighty Andes—“Giant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>

no types, perhaps, in the present or past creations. Even the cloud-capt
Himalaya, whose base extends over thousands of miles, feeds with its
substance the insatiate mouths of the Indus, the Ganges, the Burrhampooter,
and the Yrawaddy, whose turbid waves roll down to distant seas
the alluvial tribute; themselves the unconscious ministers of an Almighty
will!</p>

<p>Thus it would appear that the <i>levelling</i> principle is as operative in the
<i>physical</i> as in the <i>moral</i> world—among mountains as well as among men.
But there is one great and essential difference between the two. The
Himalaya may require thousands of years longer to wear down than the
Cordillera. This is merely a difference in time. But no time, or space,
or circumstance can effect an equilibrium in the moral or intellectual
world. If such a level could be obtained, it would instantly perish, or
recede to a greater distance than ever. Equality of this kind, like
Heaven’s bright bow—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">“Allures from far yet as we follow flies.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Equal right can never lead to equal might.</p>

<p>But to return from this digression. How is it that the Helvetian and
the Hollander, whose countries are the very antipodes of each other—whose
manners, customs, and pursuits are as different as Alps are from
sand-hills, should yet present a more striking similarity in one moral feature,
than the inhabitants of any other two countries? Of all the nations
of Europe, the Helvetians and Hollanders, inhabiting the highest and the
lowest grounds in the world, are most enthusiastically attached to their
native soils, and experience the greatest degree of nostalgic yearning
when separated from home. The <i>amor patriæ</i> of the Swiss is proverbial—that
of the Dutchman is quite as strong, though not so well known.</p>

<p>“The Hollander (says Mr. Chambers,) is bred up from his infancy to
have the highest ideas of his “<i>Vaderland</i>”—of her people—her warriors—her
wealth—her power. He is taught to consider this <i>Vaderland</i> as
standing highest in the rank of nations—that every thing belonging to
her is <i>best</i>. He is an admirer, without being a benefactor of his country—a
patriot without public spirit—contented and self-satisfied with his
country and every thing belonging thereto.”</p>

<p>The Helvetian can hardly be more enamoured of his mountains than is
the Hollander of his alluvial plains! But whence this coincidence? Is
it that the Dutchman remembers the <i>high descent</i> of his native soil—that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
it floated down from the Alps and other highlands—that it was redeemed
from the ocean by his labour and skill—enriched, fertilized, and adorned by
the industry of his forefathers—and, finally, that it had become, under his
fostering care, a second “Garden of Eden,” the pride of Batavians, and
the envy of the world?</p>

<p>Or is it that extremes approximate?—That the hardy Helvetian, raised
above the storm’s career, but whose—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Rocks by custom turn to beds of down,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">can look, with feelings of pride and independence, from his airy citadel
of health and activity, down on surrounding nations—whilst the phlegmatic
Hollander, secure from winds and waves, under the shelter of his
break-water ramparts, surveys with kindred feelings and self-gratulations
his fertile flats, his irrigated fields, and commerce-bearing canals—his
senses steeped in that musing mood, that “fool’s paradise” suspended
midway between the excitement of gin, and the tranquillity of tobacco?</p>

<p>Be this as it may, there can be little doubt that the moral and physical
character—the inward temperament and outward man—are all very much
modified by the climate, the soil, and the circumstances around us. It
might not be difficult to shew that the prominent characteristics of the
people in question are modified by these external agencies. The Hollander
is accustomed to watch, with the patience of a cat, for that precise period
when the alluvial deposits on his shores have attained that level which
permits him to stretch out his mounds of earth, and grasp the piece of
newly-emerged ground for future culture:—hence his <i>patience</i> and <i>vigilance</i>
through life, while watching the opportunity of benefiting himself.
He observes, from infancy, the labour and expense of realizing this property
in the soil:—hence his <span class="smcap">economy</span>, even to parsimony. His climate
is damp and cold: his temperament is therefore <span class="smcap">phlegmatic</span>. The surface
of his country is flat and monotonous; without monuments of antiquity,
historical renown, or classical recollections:—there is, consequently,
no more <span class="smcap">poetry</span> in his composition than in a Dutch cheese, or a stagnant
canal. Living beneath the level of the ocean, he is liable to inundations
from the watery element:—he is therefore habitually <span class="smcap">cautious</span> of all contingencies.
The equinoxes, the vernal and autumnal floods, the changes
of the moon, are all important epochs and events in a submarine territory;—he
is, therefore, a <span class="smcap">calculating</span> animal, from his cradle to his grave.
At war with the elements, he is naturally <span class="smcap">brave</span> even to obstinacy, whether
the cause be right or wrong; and will fight to the knees in blood,
rather than either advance or retreat. Monotony being almost universal,
ideality is nearly null:—the Dutchman, therefore, smokes during the
greater part of his time, in default of conversation—tobacco being, at
once, the cause and the excuse for <span class="smcap">taciturnity</span>. In Holland there are
nearly as many canals for communication, as there are dykes for defence:—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Batavian is, therefore, eminently <span class="smcap">commercial</span>:—but the limits of
the soil being narrow, and the population dense, colonization became
necessary, despite of the “<span class="smcap">Vaderlandsleifde</span>,” and emigration continues
though the colonies have dwindled away. The intellectual views
of the Hollander are nearly as limited as his geographical. There are no
mountains, whence a wide and varied prospect can be taken in by the eye—neither
are there academic eminences, from which the mind can soar
into the regions of literature, science, art, or philosophy. As it is infinitely
more difficult to raise dykes than children—to extend the soil, than
to swell the census—so the Batavian has been a political economist long
before the science was taught by Malthus, or practised by Martineau, in
this country. As a merchant, he is honest and honourable in his negociations
abroad—punctual as his pipe in receipts and disbursements at
home. Exclusively occupied with the concerns of self—whether ruminating,
fumigating, or calculating—he has little time, and less inclination,
to meddle with affairs of state. The measure of his patriotism is amply
sufficient for an abundance of loyalty—and if “passive obedience and
non-resistance” be cardinal virtues in subjects, then the Dutch ought to be
dear to the heart of their sovereign. I have no doubt that they are so.
It is only a matter of reciprocal feeling—for assuredly the sovereign is
<i>dear</i> to the Dutch.</p>

<p>Embarking at Rotterdam, the steamer ploughs its weary way through
the muddy Maas for three long days, before it reaches Cologne. One
night is spent in the malodorous town of Nymeguen—and the other on
board—so that, altogether, this is one of the most monotonous voyages
that could well be projected. There is not even the satisfaction of finding
one bank or place more ugly, or more uninteresting than another—which
would be some little variety, and afford some subject for remark. All
is puddle-dock in the near, and sand-bank in the distance. Here and
there the spire of a church, the roof of a house, or the mast of a schuyt
appears on the horizon, for a time, and vanishes again in the blank.</p>

<h4>COLOGNE.</h4>

<p>If the narrow streets of Cologne be famous, or rather infamous, for bad
smells, it is to be recollected that the <i>waters</i> of that ancient city are more
valuable than the <i>wines</i> of the neighbouring Rhine:—that they are carried
to every corner of the earth—and prized for their delicious flavour, beyond
the richest productions of Rudesheim or Johannisberg. Thus good cometh
out of evil—and the most grateful perfume is exhaled from the most malodorous
city of Europe. “Give a dog a bad name,” and the sooner you
shoot him the better. Yet if a stranger arrived at Cologne, by day or by
night, not knowing the name of the place, he might traverse its numberless
and crooked streets, without remarking more disagreeable scents than his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
nose would encounter on the banks of the Tiber, the Arno, or the Seine—in
the wynds of Auld Reekie, the Gorbals of Glasgow, the purlieus of the
Liffey—or even of father Thames, between Puddle-dock and Deptford.
I will not maintain that all the little rivulets which meander the streets of
this town, after a shower of rain, are the veritable “<i>Eau de Cologne</i>” of
Messieurs Farina; but I must say that the olfactories of my fair countrywoman
of the “Souvenirs,” were more delicate than impartial, when she
penned the following sentence. “But the dreadful effluvia of the black,
filthy streams that defile every street, penetrated even through the folds
of pocket-handkerchiefs soaked in perfume.”—<i>Souvenir</i>, p. 93.</p>

<p>Fiction being the “soul of poetry,” we need not wonder that the <span class="smcap">Bard</span>
should seize the opportunity of having his fling at poor Cologne. Accordingly
<span class="smcap">Coleridge</span> exercised his wit and his acrimony in the following
lines, in which he apostrophises <span class="smcap">Cloacina</span>, and the nymphs, “who reign
o’er sewers and sinks.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The river Rhine, it is well known,</div>
<div class="verse">Doth wash the city of Cologne,</div>
<div class="verse">But tell me nymphs, what power divine</div>
<div class="verse">Shall henceforth wash the river Rhine?”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Probably it was this real or supposed pollution which caused the noble
river to dive into the sands, soon after passing Cologne, and hide its head
for ever. It cannot be denied that Cologne is a city of the dirty and
malodorous order—and we cannot much wonder at the fact, seeing that
it was Roman in the beginning, and has never changed its nature or name
from the days of Germanicus to the present moment. After passing from
the Romans to the Franks, and from the Franks to the Germans, it became
a “<span class="smcap">Holy City</span>”—and that was enough to ruin Rome itself. It
became, of course, the rendezvous of priests, monks, and nuns, and the
seat of abbeys, monasteries, nunneries, and churches. Notwithstanding
these misfortunes, it rose into a rich and flourishing entrepôt of commerce,
when its bigotted ecclesiastical government took the wise resolution
of banishing the merchants, because most of them were Jews and
Protestants. The exiles settled in other cities on the Rhine, and left the
swarms of monks and priests among their rotten relics, to starve and
“stink in state.” Here we have a key to the malodorous effluvia that
penetrated the perfumed handkerchief of the lady of the “Souvenirs”—for
I will be bold enough to aver that she did not leave a nook or corner
unexplored in Cologne, where anything <i>curious</i> was to be seen. It is a
great pity that Napoleon, when he suppressed the convents and monasteries,
did not order the scavengers and police to sweep out all the
mouldering bones, putrefying flesh, and decomposing integuments of
saints and martyrs that have been congregated in churches, chapels, and
other monastic institutions for two thousand years. If this had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
done at Cologne, there would have been no occasion for perfumed handkerchiefs
to the noses of travellers.</p>

<p>By the way, where were the brains of the three magi, or <i>wise</i> men of
the east, (whose skulls are crowned and impearled here,) when they
allowed the suicidal decree to go forth against the merchants of Cologne?
These relics of the church perform miraculous cures of physical ills; but
they never, by any accident, prevent, much less punish, the perpetration
of moral mischief. The schoolmaster is much more wanted than the scavenger
in Cologne!</p>

<div class="verse">The shining gold their crucibles give out;</div>
<div class="verse">But faith—fanatic faith—once wedded fast</div>
<div class="verse">To some dear falsehood—hugs it to the last.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The first rush is made to the hotel—and the next to the Dom Kirche—an
unfinished cathedral, of course—like all great abbeys—for, if finished,
no more contributions could be levied. A tower of the cathedral, <i>intended</i>—abbeys,
like some other places, are “paved with good intentions”—to
be 500 feet high, but which only attained the altitude of 20 feet,
throws all sentimental tourists into ecstasies. From its brother, which
grew up much taller, a good panoramic view of Cologne and vicinity is
obtained. Then comes the tomb of skulls—the crania of the three magi—Caspar,
Melchior, and Balthasar—stolen by the mother of Constantine
from the Holy Land—conveyed by some mysterious agency from Constantinople
to Milan—and thence pillaged by Barbarossa, and presented
to the Bishop of Cologne! For 700 years these empty skulls have been
gazed at by the millions of numbskulls still emptier, that have come to
visit them! They are decorated with gilt crowns, set with pearls—and
their names are written in ruby characters!</p>

<p>Near these holy, but harmless relics, are deposited, among many masses
of bones and filth—“<i>les entrailles</i>” of Queen Marie de Medicis, together
with the head of St. Peter, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. But in the church of St. Ursula,
things are done on a grander scale. The bones of 11,000 English ladies,
who were wrecked in the Rhine, <i>on their voyage to Rouen</i>!! are here
deposited—the owners having taken the veil rather than join in wedlock
with the <span class="smcap">Huns</span>, who then possessed the Holy City. Other records say
that, in imitation of Lucretia, they sacrificed their lives to preserve their
honour—and their bones were carefully preserved from that time to this!
Did the fair lady of the “Souvenirs” hold her “perfumed handkerchief”
to her nose, while contemplating these blanched remains of her heroic
sisterhood?</p>

<p>The city of Cologne measures seven miles in circumference—her streets
are narrow—and her houses are high. Yet the population scarcely exceeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
50,000 souls—with bodies attached to them!! Thus then, it is
evident that this Holy City is one vast cemetery, partly above, and partly
under ground—a huge museum of mouldering anatomy, useless alike to
the living and the dead, and only commemorative of the weakness, darkness,
ignorance, and superstition of the human mind!</p>

<p>I confess that I was silly enough, nearly twenty years ago, to spend
some days and dollars in exploring these mummeries at Cologne; and
those who prefer such pursuits to the pure air of the mountains, and
the smiling landscapes of Nature on the banks of the Rhine, may follow
the example.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock in the morning, we left the Hotel du Rhin, and repaired
to the busy banks of the river, where steam was hissing, and tourists were
bustling into the vessels. Five or six arches of the bridge suddenly slipped
their cables, and swinging round by the impulse of the stream, opened a
free passage for the ascending and descending boats. Away they went
upwards and downwards, full of passengers—some on the tiptoe of expectation
to see the wonders of the Rhine—others, having satisfied their
curiosity, were winging their way home, to the chalky cliffs of Old
England.</p>

<h4>THE RHINE.</h4>

<p>And here we change the land of facts for the land of fictions. We now
enter the regions of romance and robbery—of love and murder—of tilts
and tournaments—of dungeons deep and turrets lofty—of crusades
against the creed of the Ottoman abroad, and of forays against the property
or life of the neighbour at home—of riot and revelry in the castle,
and of penury and superstition in the cottage—of beetling precipice and
winding river—of basaltic rock and clustering vine—of wassail war and
vintage carol. It is probable that few ascend this famous river without
experiencing some feelings of disappointment, although none will acknowledge
it, lest their taste should be condemned, and themselves voted to be
barbarians, insensible alike to the beauties of nature and the wonders of
art. But the Rhine, like many a fine child, has been spoiled—especially
by poets and painters. The tourists and romance-writers, too, have combined
to spoil the Rhine-child—for although all romance-writers are not
tourists, yet all tourists are, <i>ex officio</i>, romance-writers.</p>

<p>Thus the mountains of the Rhine, though none of them are much
higher than the rock of Gibraltar—are represented as “stupendous”—every
dingle and dell that opens between the hills, is painted as more
beautiful than the valley of Rasselas, Chamounix, or Grindenwalde—the
river itself is made to flow like liquid emeralds or sapphires, though it receives
so many muddy streams, after its partial filter in Constance, that it
is nearly as yellow as the Tiber, and as turbid as the Thames, before it gets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
half-way between Schaffhausen and Dusseldorf.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The vines too, which
are strung on stunted sticks, like onions,—enclosed between rude stone
terraces—and which more frequently disfigure than embellish the banks of
the Rhine, are extolled beyond those of Italy, which are gracefully festooned
from tree to tree, bending down the branches with the weight of
delicious grapes. Notwithstanding these and many other deficiencies on
the one hand, and exaggerations on the other (which all will acknowledge
in their hearts, though none will declare by their tongues), the Rhine is
the most picturesque, beautiful, romantic, and interesting river on the face
of our globe. I have twice ascended, and thrice descended the stream,
from its source in the Alps to its sepulture in the ocean—with various
lateral excursions—and still with undiminished pleasure. But then I
came to the survey with a conviction that, like all other places of the kind,
it was flattered by the painter, falsified by the poet, and dressed in meretricious
ornaments by the tourist and novellist. I was therefore not disappointed,
but highly gratified.</p>

<h4>DRACHENFELS.</h4>

<p>Knowing, from experience, that the first twenty miles of the Rhine
from Cologne, are totally devoid of interest, I left my companions at their
wine in the <span class="smcap">Rhenischer</span>, and started in the diligence for Bonn—and
thence to Godesberg, where I slept. Long before sunrise I had crossed
the Rhine, and threaded my way up the steeps of the Drachenfels. This
is probably the finest view on the Rhine—far superior to that which Sir
F. Head has described as taken from the top of a tree on the hill behind
the Bad-haus at Schlangenbad.</p>

<p>“The Drachenfels, which is the steepest of the Seven Mountains,
has infinitely the advantage of situation, rising abruptly from the river to
a stupendous height, clothed midway with rich vines and foliage, and terminating
in red and grey rock. On its brow are the ruins of an ancient
castle, standing on their colossal and perpendicular base—a type of man’s
perseverance and power. The magnificent and picturesque prospects
which encompass on all sides this enchanting spot, as if Nature, with a
profuse and lavish hand, had diffused around so many and varied beauties,
that having exhausted her wonted combination of mountain, hill, and dale,
with water, flowery mead, cultivated field, mantling forests, and luxuriant
vineyards, she had by this profusion of witching scenery peculiarly marked
it for her own.” This description is not exaggerated—which is saying a
great deal for it. The Drachenfels, indeed, has been immortalized by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
legendary tale, poetic lore, and pictorial delineation. An ingenious artist
of the present day, (Mr. Leigh,) has recently given a panoramic view
from the summit of this rock, with all the fidelity and minuteness of the
painter. I can corroborate the description, though I could not imitate the
picture. A short extract or two will serve as specimens.</p>

<p>“The whole of this delicious panorama was bathed in a flood of subdued
golden light, which intermingled its luscious hues with the cooler
tones of twilight. As if preparing to receive the setting sun with glory,
the horizon emitted a deep yet brilliant crimson lustre, spangled with
flakes of gold, while richer and more fantastic streaks of purple appeared
ready to envelop its glowing form as it slowly and majestically sailed behind
the darkened curtain of the distant hills. The nearer features of
this lovely scene, illumined by the silvery aspect of lingering day, were
invested with a tranquil dignity and beauty which soothed the vision as it
embraced their harmonious contours, softened by the genial light. The
more distant objects partook of the hue of the glowing west, and,
by their deep tone, enhanced the paler radiance of the more immediate
prospect.</p>

<p>“The character of the entire scene is extremely imposing: the site
whence it is beheld is sufficiently lofty to command an immense extent,
yet not so elevated as to make all around dwindle into collections of spots.
Its beauty is not of that uniform description which presents an endless
succession of cultivated points, without offering any features of striking
interest; for, while on the one side, the eye glides along vast and varied
plains, on the other, it ranges over all the diversities of a mountainous
country, from the bare and rugged castled crags to the green uplands
shelving down to picturesque valleys and streams.</p>

<p>“To the north the series of gentle eminences and valleys lose their individual
distinctions, and blend into one extensive plain, patched with the
varied colours of their produce, and dotted with the divisions of trees and
hedges which unite by their graceful lines the numerous villages that intersect
it. On this variegated expanse the serpentine course of the unruffled
Rhine may be traced like a stream of molten silver, flowing onwards towards
Cologne, its bright bosom continuously seen, occasionally bearing
specks of vessels gently descending with the current. Innumerable
towers and spires gleam amidst the verdant glades, or peer from the
deepening woods; and as the eventide breeze flows through the gentle
air, the pleasing and varied harmonies of chiming bells, afar and near,
break upon the ear.”</p>

<p>“On the same side, a series of gradual elevations, shelving down to
the Rhine, forms the commencement of the cluster of the Drachenfels,
whose bold forms sweep majestically around the towering rock of the
Dragon, like the turbulent waves of the ocean against the soaring lighthouse.
Turning to the west, the conical form of the Godesberg, surmounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
by its picturesque towers, and relieved by the sparkling habitations
at its base, stands out conspicuously from the deeper toned ridge of
hills, by which it appears shut in between Bonn and Rolandseck. Behind
this wooded screen are the diversified forms of the Eifel chain, extending
in various ramifications towards Spa, Treves, and Luxembourg, occupying
the territory between the Mosel and the Maas.”</p>

<p>“On the shore beyond, embowered amidst the surrounding uplands, is
the partially concealed town of Oberwinter; beyond which, a sharp point
of land juts into the Rhine, nearly opposite the village of Unkel. From
this point commences the interminable series of mountain summits, which
stretch along the horizon in all the grandeur of form, harmony of composition,
and fascination of colour. The eye rises from the placid bosom of
the Rhine, in which the pure sky is serenely mirrored, and, after dwelling
with rapture on the gorgeous hues of the nearer landscape, it glides with
increasing fervour over the air-drawn bulwarks which tower around this
lovely scene. These choice materials of redundant Nature, tipped with
the magical hues of a gorgeous sunset, and a translucent twilight, and invested
with the majesty of sweeping yet mellow shadows, sufficiently
account to my own mind for the lengthened description in which I have
with all humility indulged.</p>

close to the edge of a precipice as the ruined castle itself, it was impossible

<p>It is here that the poetry of the Rhine commences, together with its
legendary lore, and romantic scenery. After a comfortable breakfast at
the Eagle’s Nest Inn, and a slight survey of the topography of the rock’s
narrow crown, I climbed to the highest practicable part of the ruin, and
seating myself securely, had several hours of leisure to contemplate the
scene, and indulge in meditation. On former occasions, I had read the
legends of the Rhine, while wandering on its banks, more for amusement
than instruction, yet it never till now crossed my mind that, in the comparatively
rude ages when they were written, they might have been <i>intended</i>,
each to convey some moral lesson. The more I reflected on this subject,
the more I was impressed with the idea, and, at all events, I determined
to try my hand at the extraction of a moral from each tale, whether such
moral were originally intended or not. I could not do better than begin
with the—</p>

<h4>LEGEND OF THE DRACHENFELS.<br />
(<i>No. 1.</i>)</h4>

<p>Every visitor to this place is shewn the cavern, once occupied by a huge
dragon, to whom the neighbouring inhabitants paid divine honours, and
even offered human sacrifices. The prisoners of war were considered to
be the most agreeable victims to this Pagan monster. Among a number
of recent captives was one day found a beautiful young lady, educated in
the Christian religion. Her beauty was raising a quarrel among the conquering
chiefs, when the Elders advised that the cause of the contention
should be consigned to the dragon. She was accordingly led to the
summit of the rock, and chained to a tree. Multitudes were assembled
to view the sacrifice. The first rays of the sun that darted into the
cavern, roused the voracious reptile, who issued from his den, and directed
his tortuous course to the usual place of his bloody feast. As soon as he
came in sight, the destined victim drew from her bosom the crucifix and
image of her Saviour—fixed her eyes on the emblem of redemption—and
calmly awaited her fate. The monster gazed on his lovely and helpless
prey, already within his grasp—slackened his pace—stopped—appeared
petrified, with his basilisk eyes rivetted on the virgin. She stood as firm
as the rock beneath her or the faith within her! A thrill of horror ran
through the assembled crowd, and the silence that prevailed was still as
the grave. The moment of suspense was agonizing to the spectators;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
but continued only a few seconds, when the dragon sent forth a horrible
and unearthly yell—darted over the precipice—and disappeared for ever!
The multitude flew to the lady, unbound her chains, and fell at her feet,
as if she were an angel from Heaven. Conversion to the true faith among
the neighbouring people followed—a chapel was erected on the spot where
the miraculous interposition took place—and it was thenceforth considered
the cradle of Christianity in that part of the country.</p>

<h5>MORAL.</h5>

<p>The moral of this legend is sufficiently obvious. But it goes far beyond
the miraculous interposition of Providence, too commonly and too impiously
proclaimed in Protestant as well as in Catholic states. The legend illustrates
a great principle of human nature—the power of religion over the fear
of death—even when that death is aggravated by the horrors of merciless
cruelty and ignominious torture! Nor is it any drawback on true religion
that a <i>false faith</i> will sometimes exert a similar influence in the hour of
trial. The Hindoo widow mounts the funeral pyre of her husband, under
the influence of a religious persuasion that she is performing a sacred duty
to the dead—and braves the devouring element in the hope of joyful immortality.
It is also true that a few minds of a certain mould will spurn
the fear of death, under the influence of a greater fear—that of dishonour.
The Roman stoics, without the aid of religious faith, might prefer falling
on their own swords, to the disgrace of dragging the captive’s chains
behind the triumphal chariot of the conqueror:—but neither Cato nor
Cassius would have stood unmoved before the dragon of Drachenfels.</p>

<p>The serenity of the Christian in the hour of peril, the agony of sickness,
and the approach of death, contrasts greatly with the sullen abandonment
of the stoic, and the reckless desperation of the infidel.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here my meditations were broken by seeing the long black banner of
the steamer wreathing over the placid river, and impinging against the
sides of the hills. Descending from my airy seat, I soon joined my companions
on the crowded deck, and proceeded on our voyage. It is fashionable
for modern tourists to draw characteristic sketches of the passengers
in steam-boats on the Rhine. I think it is one of the worst theatres
that could be selected for that purpose. The scenery itself, and the
legendary tales which fix the localities in the memory, are quite sufficient
for ordinary attention, without attempting to dive into the peculiarities of
individual character, which are not so easily fathomed as the sentimental
tourist would have us to suppose.</p>

<p>We have scarcely got disentangled of the Drachenfels, when we find
ourselves between a ruined tower on the summit of a volcanic peak on the
right, and a spruce hotel in the midst of the Rhine, on a little island to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
our left. The former is the far-famed Rolandseck, and the latter is the
ancient convent of Nonnenwerth converted into a modern caravansera.</p>

<h4>ROLAND AND HILDEGUND, OR THE FATAL AFFIANCE.<br />
(<i>Legend the Second.</i>)</h4>

<p>The beautiful Hildegund and the valiant Roland (nephew of Charlemagne)
were ardently beloved by, and betrothed to each other. Roland,
however, postponed his marriage, till he had, once more, unsheathed his
sword against the infidels in Palestine. Every day of his absence seemed
a year to his Hildegund, who often listened in her bower to the praises of
her lover carolled by the boatmen of the Rhine. News arrived that the
Holy City was rescued from the Saracens, and that peace was signed:—But
Roland returned not. One evening a military knight craved hospitality
at her father’s castle. He had just returned from the seat of war,
and, to eager enquiries respecting Roland, related the manner of his death
on the field of battle, covered with honourable wounds! The effect on
the amiable Hildegund may be easily conceived. After a short noviciate
in the convent of Nonnenwerth, she took the veil, and next morning her
lover arrived at her father’s castle, expecting to fly into her arms! Petrified
by the astounding intelligence that Hildegund was wedded to Heaven,
Roland abjured all society—built himself a hermitage on the hill overlooking
the convent, and sat at its door from morning till night, listening
to the matins and vespers that ascended from the living sepulchre of his
betrothed. One day he saw a funeral on the island, and soon learnt that
it was that of his Hildegund! The next day he was found dead, sitting at
the door of his hermitage, his face turned to the convent!</p>

<h5>MORAL.</h5>

<p>The moral of this tale is homely, but not the less important on that
account. The misery resulting from long-existing affiances, where time,
or space, or adverse circumstances separate the betrothed, is of daily
occurrence, and comes within the observation of every one. How often
do we see females kept in this state of uncertainty till every prospect of
other settlement in the world has vanished—and, after all, where the
happiness of one party is blasted for ever by the death or inconstancy of
the other! Protracted courtships are bad enough; but prospective marriages
are far worse! Sat verbum sapientibus—or rather <i>amantibus</i>.</p>

<p>A certain personage in the drama of the above legend, is deserving of a
passing word—viz. the eaves-dropper—one of those unlucky tale-bearers,
whose officious tongues too often destroy the peace of whole families, and
that without <i>malice prepense</i> on the part of the babbler!</p>

<h4>THE LAST NUNS OF NONNENWERTH.<br />
(<i>Legend the Third.</i>)</h4>

<p>The history of <span class="smcap">Nonnenwerth</span> discloses a curious trait of human nature,
which has seldom been noticed. In the first moral storms of the French
revolution, a number of nuns and novices of noble families, took refuge in
the Sestertian convent of Nonnenwerth. They remained tranquil till
Napoleon came to the throne, when a great disaster threatened to overwhelm
their peaceful asylum. The emperor was a calculating philosopher,
as well as an able general. He foresaw that monasteries and
convents—especially the latter—were bad nurseries for conscripts; and
therefore, in imitation of our Eighth Henry, of blessed and pious memory,
he suppressed them all, with one stroke of his pen! The nuns of Nonnenwerth
petitioned for an exemption from the proscription, but petitioned
in vain. Josephine, like Juno, interceded with the sceptre-bearer, and
begged that the convent on the Rhine might be made an exception to the
general rule—that the nuns might be suffered to remain, and add to their
number as death thinned their ranks. Napoleon, like Jove—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent7">“——Accorded half the prayer—</div>
<div class="verse">The rest, the god dispersed in empty air.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">They were permitted to retain possession of the convent during their
natural lives—after which, Nonnenwerth was to revert to the state.
This was a great concession, and the nuns were satisfied, as they themselves
were provided for—and some favourable revolution might occur
when they were gone.</p>

<p>Time rolled on smoothly,—and, although a sister occasionally paid the
debt of nature, the event did not make a very serious impression, but only
afforded topics of reflection on the uncertainty of human life, or perhaps
recalled to the memory of the living some traits of goodness and amiability
in the dead, that had, somehow or other, escaped their notice while
their sainted sister resided amongst them. But every year diminished the
number of the survivors, till, at length, the vacant chambers and the contracted
circle at prayers and refection, forced themselves on the notice of
even the most inobservant of the sisterhood. And now it was that the
unwelcome question began to obtrude itself on the thoughts of the nuns:—“Who
shall go next to her long abode?” It required no great extent
of arithmetic to shew the strength of the establishment at present, as
compared with ten or twelve years before—and each sister began to
assume the office of actuary, and calculate the probable duration of life
within the walls of the convent! From this time, the serenity of their
minds was somewhat disturbed. The question would obtrude itself on
their thoughts, even in their devotions, and rise occasionally in the
troubled dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the inexorable tyrant did not fail to knock as regularly at
the gate of the convent as at the door of the peasant’s hut on the neighbouring
mountain.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Pallida mors æquo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas</div>
<div class="verse">Regumque turres!”—<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The social circle was narrowed every year—the number of nuns fell to 20—15—12!
About this time a new question, still more appalling than
the other, flashed across the mind of every inmate of Nonnenwerth. It
was not as to who should be the <i>first</i> to—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Leave the warm precincts of the cheerful day,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">but who was likely to be the <i>last</i> to wander in solitude round the deserted
chambers, recalling the well-known features of each departed tenant,—or,
who was to be the <i>last</i> on the bed of sickness or death, without a sister’s
smile to soothe her sufferings—or a sister’s tear to mark the spirit’s
flight? This new subject of reflection absorbed all others. Even religion
failed to calm the troubled imagination of frail mortals placed in such
singular and unnatural circumstances! Any one of them could reconcile
herself to the idea, however triste, of dying in society—but none of them
to the horrible thought of living in solitude, and departing unwept!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“On some fond breast the parting soul relies,</div>
<div class="verse">Some pious drops the dying eye requires.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This little community resembled a <span class="smcap">Tontine</span>, but with all the advantages
of such an institution completely reversed and turned into calamities.
In the civil Tontine, every lapse of life renders the remaining lives
more valuable—in the Tontine of the convent on the Rhine, it rendered
them more miserable—the consummation, the ultimatum of human misfortunes,
being still reserved for—<span class="smcap">the last Nun of Nonnenwerth</span>!</p>

<p>In one short year of epidemic influence and moral depression, the
solemn requiem was six times heard in the convent chapel, for the repose
of souls no longer to be troubled by mundane cares or fears. This reduced
the sisterhood to six.</p>

<p>There are physical pains which the body cannot long sustain—and so
are there moral prospects on which the eye of reason is unable to dwell.
This was one of them. The remaining nuns took immediate steps to
secure other asylums—and soon afterwards separated from each other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and from Nonnenwerth—for ever! The island reverted to the state,
and the convent was converted into a caravansera, whose doors are
ever open to the travelling novice, without reference to age, sex, creed,
or country.</p>

<p>This short history will suggest various reflections to the mind. The
legislator will see that solitude is more formidable to many minds than
death itself—while the philanthropist will be convinced that monastic
institutions are contrary to nature, and, as such, can never exist, without
constant supplies from society at large. The vanity of human wishes is
well illustrated by the history of Nonnenwerth. The nuns thought
themselves fortunate in securing a beautiful, healthy, and tranquil asylum
for life—little knowing how soon the convent would appear to them more
horrible than the dungeon of a prison!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Reverting from history to romance, we cannot leave the Seven Mountains
without noticing the—</p>

<h4>TREUENFELS; OR, THE ROCK OF FIDELITY.<br />
(<i>Legend the Fourth.</i>)</h4>

<p>In a lonely and desolate valley near the Rhine, some remains of a tomb
are seen, with an inscription, of which the word “<span class="smcap">Liba</span>” only is legible.
Liba was the beautiful daughter of the Chevalier Balther, and betrothed to
the brave and amiable Count de Grunstein, whom she loved. But, the
“days of true love seldom do run smooth.” Balther owed a grudge to
the pious but severe Englebert, Archbishop of Cologne, and instigated
some of the prelate’s vassals, who were also indisposed to the Archbishop,
to take away his life. Several of the malefactors were seized and executed;
all confessing at the scaffold that Balther was the person who prompted
them to the murder. These confessions induced the Emperor to order
a troop of soldiers to burn the original conspirator’s castle and all within
its walls. The order was duly executed, and, in the middle of a stormy
night, the flames ascended to the apartments of Balther and Liba. The
affectionate daughter, with the greatest difficulty, and with wonderful presence
of mind, conducted her aged father through a subterranean passage,
to the neighbourhood of the chateau; but not before the old man was
dreadfully scorched by the fire. A cavern in the mountain’s side afforded
them shelter from the vengeance of the Emperor, and the affectionate
daughter sustained her parent by fruits and roots collected every night in
the vicinity of their retreat. Meantime Balther’s eyes were entirely destroyed
by the inflammation resulting from the flames of the castle; but he
became reconciled, or at least resigned, to his afflictions and fate. One
day, he begged to be conducted to the mouth of the cavern, where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
might inhale the pure air, though he could no longer enjoy the cheerful
light of Heaven. The dutiful Liba indulged the wish of her afflicted
father, and, while they were sitting there, she espied, at no great distance,
her faithful lover, Grunstein, leaning in melancholy mood against a tree,
his javelin and dogs at his side. The first impulse of nature was to rush
into his arms, and implore his assistance; but love and reason instantly
checked her. She reflected that the asylum in Grunstein’s castle would
only expose her betrothed lover to the persecution of the Emperor. At
this moment, her father cried out that he saw the sun and the blue sky,
though his eyes were entirely destroyed. The maiden looked around, and
beheld a black speck in the heavens. She fell on her knees, and implored
the mercy and forgiveness of the Almighty towards her parent. Balther
joined in the prayer, and, at that instant, the thunder roared, and a flash
of lightning reduced the father to a cinder, and the pious daughter to a
corpse! Grunstein roused from his reverie, commenced his descent, and,
in his way down into the valley, beheld the fair form of his betrothed Liba,
apparently asleep—but totally lifeless! He erected a chapel on the spot,
dedicated to “Notre Dame des Douleurs,” and a tomb in the rock for his
Liba, where the name still remains legible.</p>

<h5>MORAL.</h5>

<p>The moral of this tale is two-fold. It illustrates the force of filial affection,
and the certainty of retributive justice.</p>

<p>The artful instigations of Balther, which induced others to commit
murder, evaded the law of the land, but did not escape the Eye of Heaven.
The cruel and illegal steps of the Emperor, in burning the castle, thus involving
the innocent with the guilty, cannot be too severely reprobated,
though it was consonant with the tyranny of those dark ages. It may
<i>seem</i> inconsistent with divine justice, that the innocent and affectionate
daughter should have been struck down by the same thunderbolt that
hurled vengeance on her father’s guilty head. But although “the ways
of Providence are dark and intricate” in appearance, they are not, as the
Roman philosopher asserts, “puzzled in mazes and perplexed with <i>errors</i>.”
The amiable Liba may have escaped a life that might have been embittered
by the memory of her father’s fate, and tainted, in the eyes of the world,
by a father’s crime. She might have involved her faithful lover in ruin—and
thus have made a bad exchange of easy death and eternal happiness,
for a lingering existence of misery and degradation!</p>

<p>The fidelity of Liba, in this legend, is only a fair sample of that moral
heroism and natural affection, that pervade the breasts of the daughter, the
mother, and the wife, as compared with those of the son, the father, and
the husband. The comparison is by no means flattering to the “stronger
sex.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At a very short distance from Nonnenwerth, we pass the town of
<span class="smcap">Unkel</span> on our left hand; and here the stream of the Rhine is narrowed
by some remarkable basaltic rocks on the opposite side of the river.
These ought to be observed by those who have not seen specimens of
this production of volcanic fire. It is the same kind of rock as that which
is seen at the Giant’s Causeway in Ireland, and at Staffa in the Hebrides.
These basaltic columns had so much obstructed the navigation of the
river at this place, that some of them were obliged to be blown up,
about forty or fifty years ago.</p>

<p>Passing by <span class="smcap">Remagen</span> on the right hand, and <span class="smcap">Linz</span> on the left, we soon
come to the ruins of Argenfels, close to the banks of the river, with its
legendary tale, which need not be noticed. Near this we have a specimen
of the <span class="smcap">Flying-bridge</span>, so common on this and other continental
rivers. A mooring is fixed in the middle of the stream, from which a
long chain or rope, suspended by small boats at convenient distances,
extends to the passage-boat, which swings from bank to bank, at the end
of this long rope, exactly like the pendulum of a clock, only it is horizontal,
not perpendicular. There is no occasion for oar or sail. The helm
of the passage-boat being turned to port or starboard, the stream of the
river acting on it, swings the tail of the pendulum, with its load of passengers,
from one bank to the other in a few minutes. Nothing can be
more simple or philosophical—but not one in one thousand of the passengers,
up and down the Rhine, comprehend the principle.</p>

<p>We soon get so accustomed to “castled crags” and mouldering castles,
that we are rather surprised, on turning our eyes from the ruins of Argenfels
on our left, to see an ancient chateau (Rheineck) on our right, resuscitated
from the sepulchre of its forefathers, and perched in new life on
an airy cliff. An old tower stands at one end, like the head-stone of a
grave, reminding the modern mansion that it too will be a ruin in its
turn!</p>

<p>Rheineck has undergone some of the transmigrations of Vishnou. It
was a Roman fort, and bore the imperial eagle on its banner. Then it
became a robber’s castle, and received the spoils of its master, torn from
their rightful owners. And now it is the residence of a philosopher (Professor
Holweg)—the seat of science, letters, and humanity. It is said to
be constructed in strict imitation of the castles of feudalism on the Rhine.
But although Rheineck has changed masters, it is still under the protection
of the same tutelar divinity—<span class="smcap">Mercury</span>, among his other numerous
avocations, having been the god of letters as well as of robbers.</p>

<div class="verse">Voce formasti, catus et decoræ</div>
<div class="verse indent14">more Palestræ.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Passing by Brohl on the right, we come to one of the most imposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and extensive ruins on the left—the shattered and scattered fragments of
Hammerstein Castle, crowning the mount and craggy rocks of the same
name. The precipices descend in rugged and jutting promontories to the
shores of the Rhine, each crowned with some remains of the ancient royal
and magnificent chateau, and presenting scanty terraces of the vine, creeping
up the crevices.</p>

<p>We soon afterwards range along the ancient town of <span class="smcap">Andernach</span>, the
ruins of which, with modern towers and spires, are backed and flanked by
a vast screen of basaltic mountains of sombre hue and antique grandeur.
Here Drusus Germanicus erected one of his fifty towers, in his Rheinish
campaigns, and in the time of Julius Cæsar.</p>

<p>The banks of the river now become more approximated, and the stream
more rapid. Steam, however, bids defiance to stream, and the vessel
ploughs its way, though with greatly retarded velocity. There is but
little remarkable between this and Coblentz, except the beautiful little
town of <span class="smcap">Neiwied</span>, with its flying-bridge, near which Julius Cæsar crossed
the Rhine—and, eighteen centuries afterwards, General Hoche, with the
victorious French army, performed the same feat, but with far more difficulty.
Here the Jew and the Gentile—the Protestant and the Catholic—the
Quaker and the Sceptic—all live upon equal terms, and with equal
rights, unmolested in the free enjoyment of their various beliefs or disbeliefs—and
travelling quietly towards the grave, or whatever “undiscovered
country” may lie beyond that bourne, without jostling each other
on the road, or forcing their creeds down the throats of their reluctant
neighbours!</p>

<p>When will the “liberty of conscience,” in our own proud country,
be uncoupled with inequality of political rights, or unattended by the
rancour of the <span class="smcap">odium theologicum</span>!</p>

<h4>COBLENTZ.</h4>

<p>The cities, towns, villages, hamlets, and even the houses along the
Rhine, bear a closer resemblance to one another (each in its class) than
in any part of the world through which I have wandered. Even the old
castles, and the rocks on which they are built, are often such fac-similes
of each other—that it is next to impossible for the acutest perception,
joined with the most retentive memory, to retain distinct ideas of these
objects, passing in rapid succession before the eye of the tourist!—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coblentz</span>, like Macedon, has a river—nay, a brace of them—one
brown, the other blue.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> As necessary consequences, there are two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
bridges, as unlike one another, as any two things of the same kind can
well be. One rests its foundations on the rocky bed of the Moselle—the
other on the turbid surface of the Rhine. There is a number of streets—a
great number of houses—and a still greater number of people, amounting
to some 12,000. Then there are churches enough, considering the
number of church-goers—and in some of them, there are more dead
bodies present at divine service, than living souls. There is a palace—not
that of a prince, but of justice. There is good water and good wine;
but both of them are brought over the Moselle bridge. Of hotels, there
is no lack; the masters and “<i>kellners</i>” of which can tell a “hawk from
a handsaw”—and more than that, they can distinguish an Englishman
from a native, as readily as they can a Thaler from a Kreutzer. Coblentz
has evidently more strength than wealth—more soldiers than merchants—more
shells than yolks—more articles of war than of commerce. Her
high loop-holed walls along the banks of the river, with one or two
wharves, shew that she is compressed into a military fortress, rather than
expanded into a fine mart of commerce!</p>

<h4>EHRENBREITSTEIN.</h4>

<p>The following are the sentiments of two pictorial artists. “The whole
surface of the rock, glowed with the richest hues of sunset—its naturally
deep-toned and richly coloured form assuming an endless diversity of
tints combined with a focus of harmonious light, and relieved by the
broad shadows of the surrounding objects.”—<i>Leigh.</i></p>

<p>“We behold the mighty and stupendous rock of Ehrenbreitstein,
crowned with fortifications—<i>the Gibraltar of the Rhine</i>—rising in towering
majesty, and frowning in sullen grandeur on the beautiful and picturesque
city of Coblentz, casting its deep and darkened shadow over the
calm and glassy surface of the Rhine beneath.”—<i>Tomlinson.</i></p>

<p>I have been often past, and sometimes over this “broad stone of
honour,” and, I confess that, to my eye, it is about as shapeless and unpicturesque
a mass of mountain as I ever beheld. It is a huge truncated
cone—the lower-fourth of an enormous sugar-loaf—an Egyptian pyramid,
cut down to the first floor—or rather it is a gigantic butcher’s block, on
which a good bit of <i>mangling</i> has been done in its time. There is really
but little that excites interest about the fortress, except its massive and
passive strength—its <i>vis inertiæ</i>—its impenetrability by shot or shells.
You might as well batter <span class="smcap">Ben Nevis</span> as Ehrenbreitstein! You might
sweep its rugged brow of every man, mortar, parapet, and bastion, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the rugged, dogged rock would stand in all its “brute force,” unmoved by
the iron showers that fell on its head!</p>

<p>“The <span class="smcap">Gibraltar</span> of the Rhine!” No man who ever viewed that renowned
fortress, would have made the comparison. I resided on the rock
several months, and every feature of it is as fresh in my mind’s eye, as it
was 40 years ago, when I last left it. Imagine a gigantic rock rising out
of the ocean to a height of fifteen hundred feet, connected with the main
land only by a narrow, low isthmus of sand—with three sides perpendicular
(North, East, and South), and one sloping at an angle of 45 degrees
from the summit of the mountain to the water’s edge, sprinkled with little
gardens and lodges—while the sea-line is bristled with batteries and
flanked by spit-fire tongues, bearing the heaviest artillery, behind which
lies a town, containing specimens of every nation between the Ganges and
the Atlantic. Through the perpendicular cliffs that overhang the neutral
ground, vast galleries for cannon, and profound excavations for ammunition,
are cut, tier over tier, pointing destruction upon every foot of the
isthmus below. Then the ruins of the old Moorish castle, perched on the
crags at one extremity of the rock, while <span class="smcap">Europa Point</span>, a high table-land
a hundred feet above the level of the sea, stretches out to the South,
like a splendid parade, with barracks, hospitals, &amp;c. But oh! from O’Hara’s
tower on the summit, what a glorious prospect! The boundless and tideless
Mediterranean to the East—the vast and heaving Atlantic to the West—the
fantastic mountains of Grenada to the North—and Africa fading
away towards Carthage and Algiers to the South.</p>

<p>There is not, there cannot be a spot on this earth where such an extensive,
magnificent, varied, and beautiful view (one hundred miles in radius)
can be obtained, as from the summit of Gibraltar—a spot unique, between
two mighty oceans, and two great continents—having Africa and Europe,
the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, as it were, at your feet!</p>

<p>Is it nothing to stand on one of the “<span class="smcap">Pillars of Hercules</span>” and contemplate
the other within a few miles of you? Descending into St. Michael’s
cave, near the apex of the rock, we find ourselves surrounded by
thousands and tens of thousands of stalactitic figures, assuming the grotesque
forms of everything which the most fertile imagination could conceive—dispersed
through caverns where human step has never been able
to trace the depth or extent—and supposed to form subterranean, or rather
submarine, communications with the opposite fortress of Ceuta in Africa!
Wander through the town, and you will observe the costume, the language,
the manners, the habits, the productions, the features—almost the
passions and thoughts of every people on earth—from the Calmuc Tartar
of the East, to the Red Indian of the West—from the Laplander of the
North, to the Hottentot of the South. To compare Gibraltar with Ehrenbreitstein,
then, is to compare “Hyperion with a Satyr”—or Vesuvius
with the funnel of a steam-boat. I leave the prodigies of valour performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
by Englishmen, in taking and retaining the key of the Mediterranean, out
of the question, believing that Prussian arms would, under similar circumstances,
have achieved equal exploits. Of all nations, <i>we</i> have the least
reason to doubt the prowess of Prussia. She fought at our side, when the
destinies of Europe vibrated in the balance!</p>

<h4>COBLENTZ TO MAYENCE.</h4>

<p>Between Cologne and Coblentz it is mere child’s play for the tourist.
The stream is wide, and the attractive objects are so reasonably distant
from one another, that the traveller has time to consult his map, peruse
Schreiber, and even con over some of the shorter legends, between castle
and castle. But it is another affair above Coblentz. The stream becomes
more confined and tortuous—the banks more abrupt and contiguous—the
ruins, towns, and villages more numerous—the embarkations and debarkations
more frequent, with all their consequences of hurly-burly among
the passengers, topsyturvy of luggage, scrambling after books, charts, and
sacs-de-nuits, bowings, kissings, and embracings, or, as Hood would say,
“omni-bussings,” among goers and comers, together with the clattering
of plates and dishes, and the chattering of all known and unknown tongues—these,
and many other interruptions, sadly discompose the contemplations
of the philosopher, and the musing meditations of the tourists in
pursuit of the picturesque, or the Syntaxes in search of the sublime.</p>

<p>The “Rhenish Confederacy” must have had a most salutary influence
in fraternising the people of these provinces. Not only does every German
in the steamer salute his “cousin Germans” on both cheeks; but, if his
neck were long enough, he would kiss every man, woman, and child, on
both banks of the river, from Cologne to Constance! These palpable inosculations,
however, being impracticable, the caps and hats are converted
into social telegraphs, which</p>

<div class="verse">“Speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul,”</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and establish a chain of sympathies and reciprocities between land and
water along the whole course of the Rhine.</p>

<h4>STOLZENFELS.</h4>

<p>We have proceeded but a little way above Coblentz, when we find ourselves
between two remarkable ruins—one on the banks of the Lahn,
(Lahenec), and one on our right—<span class="smcap">Stolzenfels</span>. This last has a short
legend attached to it, which may be glanced at, <i>en passant</i>.</p>

<p>The robber chief of this strong-hold was remarkable, even among the
Rhine-robbers, for cruelty and ferocity. This was not all. He contemned
the gods, and laughed at religion as the superstition of the ignorant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
In the intervals of robbery and murder, he amused himself with tormenting
his vassals, whose lives hung upon the mere caprice of their tyrant lord.
One evening, while carousing and scoffing, the light of the moon was suddenly
obscured—flocks of ravens flew screaming through the air—darkness
overspread the Rhine—and distant thunder was heard growling among the
mountains. The Stolzenburger turned pale, and, for the first time in his
life, fell on his knees to pray. Before he could utter a word, a dreadful
crash was heard—a thunderbolt had struck the castle—and the tyrant was
buried in the ruins!</p>

<h5>MORAL.</h5>

<p>A death-bed repentance may be better than none; but that piety which
is extorted by terror, hardly deserves the name.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The long and straight reach of the river, from the entrance of the Lahn
to the chateau of Liebneck, presents no striking feature, except the frowning
castle (now an hospital) of <span class="smcap">Marksburg</span>, crowning an apparently inaccessible
mountain, which modern art might render impregnable. In another
reach or two, we pass Boppart, and come to the scene of a legendary
tale.</p>

<h4>THE BROTHERS; OR, LIEBENSTEIN AND STERNFELS.<br />
“The course of true love never did run smooth.”<br />
(<i>Legend the Fifth.</i>)</h4>

<p>A little above <span class="smcap">Boppart</span>, but on the opposite side of the river, two mouldering
ruins, on two craggy rocks, close to each other, arrest the attention
of even the most indifferent passenger. The legend attached to them is
of a very melancholy character. A nobleman had two sons and an amiable
ward, of whom both of the brothers were enamoured. The elder resigned
his pretensions, and retired to Rheuse, a part of the family estate.
The younger was affianced to, and beloved by, the beautiful ward, <span class="smcap">Eloise</span>,
whose name deserves to be transmitted to posterity. The Holy, but
insane Crusades, however, induced the intended bridegroom to join the
military bigots of that day, in a war of extermination against the Musselmen.
The result of his religious zeal was the conquest—not of the Holy
City, but of a Grecian mistress, with whom he returned to his castle on
the Rhine. The elder brother (Liebenstein), incensed at this double crime
(profanation of the crusade and breach of his vows to the lady), challenged
him to mortal conflict. The amiable ward (Louisa) rushed between the
combatants—prevented fratricide—and immediately took the veil. The
guilty pair led, at first, a riotous, but soon a wretched life. The Grecian
lady proved faithless, and eloped! The brothers became reconciled—lived
in the contiguous castles, whose ruins are still seen—and died without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
issue!—The property of the ward was dedicated to the purpose of founding
a convent (Bornhoffen) at the foot of the mountain on which the castles
were built. As to the brothers—</p>

<h5>MORAL.</h5>

<p>The darker features of this drama are every day seen on the stage of
life. Lovers’ vows plighted, soon to be broken—man’s promises of eternal
love cancelled—women’s hopes and happiness blighted—but perfidy
sooner or later punished.</p>

<p>It was enough for Sternfels to bring home a mistress from Palestine,
without parading his guilty partner before the eyes of his betrothed and
insulted Louisa. Yet this, <i>and worse</i>, we every day witness! Sternfels’
punishment was not light. The ingratitude of his mistress, and a life of
solitude and remorse, were severe chastisements!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Winding along from the ruins last-mentioned, we come to a very striking
object, a little short of St. Goar, which attracts the attention of all
passengers. It is a dismantled fortification, still black with the powder by
which it was blown up in the French revolution. The <span class="smcap">Rheinfels</span> was
long a robber-fortress of the first water, and its tyrant chiefs carried their
depredations and extortions to such a height as to league all the adjacent
provinces against them. The chiefs held out and defied the country; but
at length the strong-hold fell—and, with it, the whole of the brigand castles
on both sides of the Rhine.</p>

<h4>LURLEY, OR THE ECHO.<br />
(<i>Legend the Sixth.</i>)</h4>

<p>Almost immediately after passing the ruins of the Rheinfels, we enter a
narrow and sombre river gorge, where the stream is impetuous, turbulent,
and tortuous; the cliffs of dark basalt rising almost perpendicular, but in
rugged strata or layers, inclining in all directions from the horizontal to
nearly the vertical. Here the Rhine like its sister the Rhone—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent7">——“Cleaves its way between</div>
<div class="verse">Rocks that appear like lovers who have parted</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
<div class="verse">In haste; whose mining depths so intervene,</div>
<div class="verse">That they can meet no more, though broken-hearted.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And here is still heard that prattling nymph, Miss <span class="smcap">Echo</span>, who, like many
a descriptive tourist, repeats her parrot-note for the tenth time—with no
other variation than that of diminished force and distinctness. This lady,
who, when young, was dismissed from the skies for allowing her tongue
to wag too freely, has since endured the severe punishment of keeping
silent, except when spoken to! She is not permitted to ask, but only to
iterate questions—having the privilege, on some rare occasions, and in
some peculiar places, of repeating the said question, or rather the last
word or syllable of it twice or even many times. The present spot is one
of these favourite localities—and the voices which she loves to hear and to
imitate are those of the cannon, the bugle, and the horn. The clanking
and plashing of the steamers are unfavourable to the delicate iterations of
Echo, and often drown her voice entirely. Though not so witty as her
sister of Killarney, who answers, instead of repeating the questions put
to her, yet she occasionally cracks a joke on the mayor of the neighbouring
town, when some stentorian German bawls out from the opposite
rock, “<i>Who is the mayor of Oberwesel?</i>” The damsel, with a faint but
clear titter, replies, “<i>esel</i>”—or ass! so that lord mayors on the banks
of the Rhine, as well as of the Thames, are sometimes treated with
ridicule.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that boat-wrecks, raft-wrecks, and loss of life
were of frequent occurrence in a locality like this, where the rapid stream
is twisted into whirlpools, between rugged banks, the very proximity of
which increases the difficulty of the passage, and the danger of drowning,
where the vessel or flotilla is stranded. The eddying surge, the sunken
rock, and the serrated perpendicular shore, in a dark and tempestuous
night, must render the navigation of this dreary ravine most hazardous—and
escape, in case of an overturn, all but hopeless.</p>

<p>That a place so singular and so perilous, coupled with a remarkable and
musical echo, should become the scene of some popular or superstitious
legend, is not at all wonderful. Accordingly a fourth <span class="smcap">Siren</span> was added
to the classical list, and located on the banks of the Rhine, instead of the
coast of Sicily, to lure (lurlei) the enchanted mariner from his helm or
oar, by her melodious song, and wreck himself and bark on the treacherous
rocks. Lurley carried on the trade of her elder sisters for some time,
with considerable success, but not without some redeeming qualities; for
she often pointed out the best places for the poor fishermen to cast their
nets. At length a young Palatine Count determined to emulate the hero
of Ithaca, and break the spell of the enchantress. For that purpose he
embarked on the Rhine, and steered towards the dangerous pass, but
without taking the precaution of the wily Greek, to stop the ears of the
crew with wax, and cause himself to be bound to the mast. As the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
count’s barge approached the rocks, Lurley poured forth one of her most
melodious lays over the face of the river. The men dropped their oars,
and the count’s senses were all absorbed in listening to the divine strains.
A sudden eddy of the stream whirled the boat’s head towards the shore—another
dashed her against the rocks—and, in another instant, all were
engulphed in the boiling whirlpool!</p>

<p>This catastrophe caused a great sensation, and the count’s father sent a
veteran warrior, with a select party of soldiers, to surround the rock, and
seize the sorceress. On approaching the summit, Lurley was seen for the
first time by human eyes, with arms, ankles, and neck encircled with
corals, and even her flowing tresses braided with the same emblems of the
deep. She demanded their purpose. The veteran announced his determination
to force her into the Rhine, there to expiate the death of the
young count. Lurley replied, by throwing her corals into the river, singing
at the same time—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Entends ma voix, puissant Pere des eaux,</div>
<div class="verse">Fais parter, sans delai, tes rapides chevaux.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Instantly a great storm arose—the river boiled with foam—and two
towering waves, bearing some resemblance to milk-white steeds, surged
along the rock, and bore <span class="smcap">Undine</span> (for such was the nymph) to her paternal
grottoes under the waters. From that time the song of Lurley was
never heard; but her spirit still hovers about her favourite rocks, and
mimicks the voices of the boatmen as they pass the place.</p>

<p>The veteran warrior returned to the count’s father, and was agreeably
surprised to find the son safely returned to his paternal mansion by the
kind <span class="smcap">Undine</span>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A contemplation of this locality irresistibly leads me to the conclusion
that, here existed in some remote period, a cataract, similar to that now
existing, but rapidly crumbling down, as at Schaffhausen. The alluvial
plains between Heidelberg and the present bed of the Rhine, were unquestionably
a large lake, which would be drained by the wearing down
of a cataract at some lower part of the river. When the falls of the
Rhine at Schaffhouse are reduced to mere rapids, it is probable that the
lake of Constance will become an alluvial valley. The valley of the
Rhone was once a lake, till the flood-gate at St. Maurice gave way, and
converted the lake into a plain. The huge walls of basaltic rock piled up
in strata on each side of the Rhine at Lurley, torn by fire and worn by
water, draw the mind to contemplate the myriads of years which must
have rolled along, since first they upsprung from the bowels of the earth
in liquid lava—and the countless ages required to form this sombre gorge
by the mere attrition of the unceasing current!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<h4>SCHOMBERG.</h4>

<p>While passing the picturesque little town of Oberwesel, and just beyond
the Lurley-rocks, we raise the eye to the ruins of <span class="smcap">Schomberg</span>, possessing
some interest to the British traveller, as the patrimonial castle of Duke
Schomberg, who lost his life in the battle of the Boyne. Alas! that the
very name of a mouldering ruin should, after the lapse of a century and a
half, engender in the breasts of the same people, living under the same
government, professing the same religion, speaking the same language,
and having the same interests, such deadly sentiments of hatred and animosity!
No two feudal robbers and enemies on the banks of the Rhine,
ever viewed each other with such cut-throat propensities, as do the Orange-man
and White-boy on the banks of the Boyne! A century and a half
hence, when the fiery passions of the present day shall have long been
quenched in the grave, and the immortal spirits shall be awaiting the verdict
of a final tribunal, posterity will scarcely believe that, amongst their
ancestors, Christian charity meant murderous extermination—and that
the surest road to Heaven was that which was tracked with the blood of
our neighbours! The glorious orb of day shines as joyously over those
mouldering ruins, as when the proud castle first rose in majesty over the
frowning precipices—nay, as when the Rhine itself first began to trickle
from the virgin snows of the Alps:—and why should not the heavenly
light of Christianity shed its benign influence over the professors of that
faith, as well now, as when the <span class="smcap">Redeemer</span> inculcated charity and forbearance
during his mission on earth? No! It is much easier to preach
than to practise the Christian virtues—and the former is considered the
more efficacious of the two, by the disciples of <span class="smcap">Faith</span>.</p>

<h4>THE SEVEN SISTERS; OR, THE FATE OF COQUETTES.<br />
(<i>Legend the Seventh.</i>)</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Cupid</span> is not a god that may be safely tampered with. His arrows are
sharp, his feelings are keen, and his resentments are sometimes implacable.
Seven beautiful sisters resided in the castle of Schomberg, overhanging
the Rhine; and their hearts were as insensible to love as are the seven
rocks in that river near Oberwesel, which now bear their names. Their
charms and their wealth attracted crowds of suitors from various quarters.
The sisters, however, gave smiles to all, yet favours to none of their admirers.
Proffers of marriage were always declined, and sometimes treated
with levity. Vanity was their ruling, almost their only passion, and adulation
was its food. Their public suitors were the subjects of their private
merriment. But mischief sometimes mingled with their mirth. By words,
looks, or demeanour, they occasionally seemed to shew a preference to certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of their admirers. This led to jealousies, quarrels, bloodshed, and
even death. The ranks, however, were constantly filled up by adventurous
and ardent lovers, as the Byzantine throne (according to Gibbon) was
never without a tenant, though the grave was always ready dug at its
foot! But beauty, which is the gift of Nature and Chance, is the first
charm which falls before the hand of Time. The sisters had only this one
personal attraction, and it began to fade. The suitors diminished in number,
and at length totally disappeared! It was then too late to remedy
the evil of their own vanity and cruelty. The scene of their former
flattery had now become insupportable, and they prepared to remove
across the Rhine to a sequestered retreat, where their wounded pride and
present humiliation might alike be buried in obscurity. They selected a
dark night for leaving their castle and passing the river. When near the
<span class="smcap">Lurley Rocks</span>, the gnome of that place, who had often witnessed the imprudent
and unfeeling conduct of her neighbouring sisters, lured the boatmen
towards a treacherous sunken shoal, when the vessel was overturned,
and all were buried in a watery grave! The Seven Sisters are still seen
occasionally, in very low states of the river, raising their heads out of the
water, in the form of rocks, and struggling with the foaming and impetuous
current!</p>

<h5>MORAL.</h5>

<p>The moral of this short legend is transparent. The coquette, the flirt,
the jilt, is a kind of moral swindler who, having no feelings or affections
herself, trifles with those of others. It must be confessed that there are
similar characters among the other sex, who are, if possible, still more reprehensible.
But the female who plays this disreputable game, runs a
greater risk, for obvious reasons, than the male deceiver. The foregoing
legend illustrates the danger of relying on mere personal charms, as the
great magnet of attraction. Qualities and accomplishments of mind
are more durable, and more to be depended on, than beauty of form or
feature!</p>

<h4>PFALZ.</h4>

<p>The robbers of the Rhine were not content with building depôts for
stolen, or rather plundered goods, on every eminence, and levying “black
mail” on every kind of land carriage; but they invaded “the free navigation
of the Rhine,” as some of their descendants now do. A rock on
the river whereon to erect a toll-bar was a great treasure in days of yore.
The quadrupeds of the mouse-tower were much less voracious and graminivorous,
than the bipeds of the same. The latter might not perhaps
have nibbled at the body of a bishop, but they took good care to shear his
flocks, in their transit up and down the Rhine. Nearly opposite <span class="smcap">Caub</span>
we pass close to an object which looks like a dwarf castle, sailing up the
stream on the back of a whale. This was a very convenient edifice for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the Rhenish palatines of the adjacent castle of <i>Stahlee</i>. It served the
purpose of a custom-house, to collect the “rint,” and a prison to secure
the refractory:—in other words, it performed the double function of dungeon
and douane. One of the involuntary tenants of this narrow crib,
was the own and the only daughter of Conrad, the palatine himself, whose
name was Agnes. The lady had been betrothed, with her parents’ and
her own consent, to Henry Duke of Brunswick; but a king having offered
his hand, Conrad commanded her to change her affections, and set them
on a higher rank than that of a duke. Agnes demurred in her own
breast, though not openly; for affection, like faith or belief, will not come
or go at our own bidding—much less at that of another. In the temporary
absence of the father, Agnes, with the consent and privity of her
mother, was privately married to the duke. When Conrad learnt this, he
ordered his daughter to the Pfalz, till the marriage could be dissolved.
Meantime it soon became evident that certain proofs of prior attachment
on the part of Agnes, would be too unequivocal to escape the notice of the
regal suitor, if the marriage were annulled; and Conrad, after a double
confinement of Agnes in the Rhine prison, became reconciled to the duke—and
all ended happily.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Passing <span class="smcap">Bacharach</span> and the “<span class="smcap">Ara Bacchi</span>,” which shews its propitious
face in fertile vintages, we soon come to <span class="smcap">Lorch</span>, where we have a
legend that must not be passed unnoticed.</p>

<h4>TEMPTATION, OR THE HALL OF A HUNDRED MIRRORS.<br />
(<i>Legend the Eighth.</i>)</h4>

<p>Three students from Nuremburg, determined, during one of their vacations,
to make the tour of the Rhine. Arrived at Lorch, they learnt that
the sombre and triste valley of Wesperthal, behind Mount Kedrick, was
the habitation of hobgoblins, who failed not to harass and frighten every
one who penetrated into its dreary recesses. This account only stimulated
their curiosity, and tempted their courage. They therefore repaired
to the valley, and were soon treading on fairy ground. While wandering
about, they came to an enormous mass of rock, bearing some rude resemblance
to an old castle. In its sides were several apertures, like gothic
windows, and its summit was something in the shape of a dome. Presently
at one of these apertures there appeared three young ladies of surpassing
beauty, who, instead of frowning on the young cavaliers, invited
them, by their smiles and signals, to approach the castle. They soon
found a narrow door, through which they entered, and passing along a
kind of avenue, they came to a stair-case, which they mounted, and entered
a vast and magnificent vestibule. They had scarcely time to cast a
glance around them, when they were involved in the most Cimmerian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
darkness. After groping about, for some time, they discovered a door,
which they managed to force open, when they found themselves in a
splendid hall, illumined by hundreds of chandeliers, and covered from the
dome to the floor with brilliant mirrors. But instead of finding the three
nymphs, who had beckoned them from the windows, they were astounded
by the sight of at least three hundred, who all stretched out their hands,
at once, while welcoming the three youths to their father’s mansion!
The students were stupified, not knowing which to address, or whom to
salute, so bewildered were they by the reflection of three hundred beauties,
and double that number of hands, from the surrounding mirrors!
Their embarrassment was not lessened by the peals of laughter set up by
the mischievous nymphs. In the midst of this scene, a door opened, and
a venerable old man, with locks like snow, but clothed in jet black vestments,
entered. “Welcome, my children,” said he; “you are come, no
doubt, to demand my daughters in marriage. You shall have them, and
with each a hundred weight of solid gold. But there is one condition.
My daughters have lost their pet birds, and you must search for them,
and bring them back from yonder wood.” “<i>Take each your partner</i>,”
then said the old man, in a voice of thunder. The youths stepped forward,
each to seize the hand of his mistress—but grasped only empty air.
At this, the father joined his daughters in a peal of laughter. When the
merriment had subsided, the old man led the young suitors to the real
nymphs, whose salutes assured the students that they were real flesh and
blood, and whose beauty soon captivated their whole souls. They were
now eager to fulfil the condition imposed upon them. “You will recognize
the <span class="smcap">Starling</span>,” says the old man, “by the riddles which it has got
by rote and is always propounding—the <span class="smcap">Rook</span> by its hoarse croak—and
the <span class="smcap">Magpie</span>, by the burthen of its chatter, being the birth, parentage, and
education of its grandmother.” They set out for the forest, and soon
found the three birds, perched on the branch of an oak, chattering and
chanting the ditties which they had been taught in the chateau. I have
only room for the magpie’s theme—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Ma grand-mêre etait une pie,</div>
<div class="verse">Qui pondait des œufs d’ou sortaient des pies.</div>
<div class="verse">Et si elle n’etait pas morte,</div>
<div class="verse">Elle serait encore en vie.”<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The young gentlemen soon secured the pet birds, and returned with
them to the castle. But what a change presented itself to their horrified
senses! The chateau was gray with moss—the hall deprived of its mirrors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and lustres, and only exhibiting naked walls! In three niches, sate
three withered, tawny, toothless hags, with wine and fruit before them, on
three small tables! They instantly rose, and stretched out their wrinkled,
yellow, and skinny arms to embrace their lovers, while they mumbled and
snivelled, from mouths and noses, their nauseous welcomes, and most
loving assurances of eternal attachment and fidelity! To add to the mortification
of the bridegrooms, the three pet birds joined their mistresses in
such a chorus of squallings, croakings, and catterwaullings, that the young
men were obliged to stop their ears to keep out the infernal din! Meanwhile
the withered witches led their paramours to the tables, and presented
them refreshments, for which they had little stomach. Each,
however, took a glass of exquisite wine, which they had scarcely swallowed,
when they fell into a state of complete insensibility! When they
awoke, which was not till mid-day, they found themselves lying among
prickly bushes at the foot of a tall rock, worn into furrows by the storms
and rains, their limbs so cold and stiff that they had the greatest difficulty
in retracing their steps! While dragging their weary limbs along, they
were saluted from every projecting rock by the old hags—and from every
branch of tree by the chatterings and croakings of the cursed pet birds!
On clearing the valley, the young gentlemen made a vow never again to
pay attention to the allurements of female beauty, when proffered on the
“voluntary system” of the nymphs of <span class="smcap">Wesperthal</span>.</p>

<h5>MORAL.</h5>

<p>I think the allegory of Wesperthal is little inferior to that of <span class="smcap">Circe</span>,
or even of the Syrens. It combines, indeed, the morals of both. Under
the head of curiosity and thirst of rash adventure, are shadowed forth the
headstrong passions of youth. Then the allurements and temptations by
which they are so easily led from the paths of virtue—the Cimmerian
darkness in which they are plunged—the blaze of false light, glittering
tinsel, and meretricious splendour that attracts them on to their ruin—the
penalties which are soon exacted from this short-lived felicity—the stupor
in which their senses are drowned—and the remorse and horror in which
they finally wake from the delirium of “passion’s wild career.”</p>

<p>Among some sly strokes of irony conveyed in this allegory, the accomplishments
of the “pet birds” are biting satires on the education and
mental habits of their mistresses in the chateaus of that time. Happily
for us, there are <i>now</i> no charades of the starling, croakings of the rook,
or magpie chatterings about ancestral honours, among the wives and
daughters of the nineteenth century.</p>

<h4>THE DEVIL’S LADDER.<br />
RUTHELM AND GARLINDA, OR LOVE REWARDED AND INHOSPITALITY PUNISHED.<br />
“Omnia vincit amor.”<br />
(<i>Legend the Ninth.</i>)</h4>

<p>There cannot be a doubt that the legend of the “<span class="smcap">Devil’s Ladder</span>,”
was clearly intended to convey a double moral, as will presently be
seen.</p>

<p>Over the little town of <span class="smcap">Lorch</span>, rises abruptly the craggy, and apparently
inaccessible mountain of <span class="smcap">Kedrick</span>, on which is a solitary tower.
<span class="smcap">Sibo</span>, the Chief of Lorch, was a gloomy, eccentric, and rather misanthropic
character. One stormy night, a decrepid old creature, of extremely
dwarfish stature, rapped at his door, and demanded the usual rights of
hospitality, commonly accorded in that age of chivalry. <span class="smcap">Sibo</span> drove him
from his gate with rudeness, and even brutality. Next day, when the
dinner-bell rang, <span class="smcap">Garlinda</span>, the only child of <span class="smcap">Sibo</span>, a beautiful girl,
twelve years of age, was nowhere to be found! Search was made in all
directions, but in vain. A shepherd, however, reported that, early in the
morning, he saw a young girl, who was culling flowers at the foot of the
Kedrick, surrounded and seized by a number of little old men, who climbed
with her up the mountain. The chevalier cast his eyes towards the summit
of the steep, and clearly discerned his daughter there, who appeared
to be stretching her arms towards her parent’s habitation! The vassals
were summoned, and numerous efforts were made to scale the rock; but
every attempt was frustrated by fragments of stone coming down the precipices
with such fury, that the men were forced to fly for their lives.
The wretched <span class="smcap">Sibo</span> now endeavoured by penances, prayers, donations to
the churches, monasteries, and convents, as well as distributions among
the poor, to propitiate the powers above, and regain his only child.
Heaven seemed hardened against him, and the gnomes of Kedrick retained
their captive. The only consolation of the father was, that Garlinda was
seen at sunrise and sunset, looking from her airy prison down to the valley
of Lorch. Days, months, and years rolled on, without any prospect of
regaining his lost treasure. Meantime, every care was taken of Garlinda’s
health and comfort by the fairies of the rock—and especially by an aged
female gnome, who watched her assiduously, and occasionally gave her
hopes of deliverance from captivity.</p>

<p>Four years had now elapsed, and <span class="smcap">Sibo</span> gave up all expectation of recovering
his daughter; when <span class="smcap">Ruthelm</span>, a brave young knight, who had
distinguished himself in the wars against the Infidels, returned to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
place of his nativity, near Lorch. On learning the fate of Garlinda, he
determined to effect her rescue, or sacrifice his life. Her father promised
the hand of the lady to her deliverer. Ruthelm reconnoitred, with
anxious eye, every side of the rocky mountain; but no part offered the
least prospect of escalade. It rose like a rugged wall in every direction!
Returning to his chateau in pensive meditation, he met a diminutive dwarf
on the road, who accosted him, and asked him if he had heard the story
of Garlinda’s captivity on the summit of Kedrick? On replying in the
affirmative, the dwarf hinted that he could effect her freedom if Ruthelm
promised to marry her. The lover eagerly closed with the proposal, and
the dwarf vanished from his sight.</p>

<p>The youthful knight began to fear that the promise of the dwarf was a
deception, when an aged female gnome stood before him, and presenting
him with a small bell, desired him to repair to the valley of Wesperthal,
a gloomy and haunted ravine behind the Kedrick, and there seek the
entrance of a deserted mine, which he would recognize by two old pine
trees that grew at its mouth. When he had descended a few steps into
the mine, he was to ring the bell thrice, and abide the result. Ruthelm
was punctual to the directions, and found the place. As soon as the bell
was rung, a light was seen rising from the bottom of the mine, and presently
a dwarf appeared, and demanded what Ruthelm wanted. He related
the promise of the female dwarf, and her injunction to ring the bell
which she had given him. The dwarf examined the bell. The inhabitant
of the mine commanded Ruthelm to be at the foot of the mountain before
the dawn of next morning. Then drawing a small trumpet from his
girdle, he sounded it thrice, when instantly the ravine and the whole
valley swarmed with gnomes carrying ropes, hatchets, saws, and hammers.
In a few minutes trees were heard falling down the sides of the
ravine, felled by the axes of the gnomes, while hundreds of these nimble
gentry were busily employed in forming the wood into the different parts
of the ladder.</p>

<p>Ruthelm slept little that night, and was at his post before the dawn of
morn. He found the ladder placed against the perpendicular precipice,
and reaching to its highest pinnacle. He began to mount the ladder;
but the terrific vibrations and oscillations of the slender machine, required
all the courage of a hero, and all the devotion of a lover—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent7">——lest the deficient sight</div>
<div class="verse">Topple down headlong.——</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At length he reached the summit of the rock, and was rewarded for his
hazard, by the sight of Garlinda reclining asleep in a bower of roses and
eglantine. Her beauty surpassed all that had been reported, even by her
own friends. While gazing on the sleeping nymph, she awoke, and
Ruthelm dropped on his knee. At that instant the little old man, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
had carried off Garlinda, stood before them, and, with frowning looks,
demanded the name of the intruder, the cause of his visit, and the means
by which he had ascended the mountain? Ruthelm firmly replied, that
he came to deliver Garlinda from her prison, and restore her to an affectionate,
but broken-hearted parent—that the means of his access would
be explained by the bell, which he held in his hand. Garlinda, at these
words, burst into a flood of tears, and entreated the dwarf to allow her to
visit her father. The dwarf paused for a moment, and then replied:—“Your
father, Garlinda, has been amply punished for his inhospitality,
and you deserve reward for your patience and resignation. For you, Sir
Knight, (addressing Ruthelm,) the jewel you seek is not yet purchased,
even by the perils you have encountered. A more dangerous task remains—the
descent from this mountain. You must return by the ladder; I will
conduct Garlinda by a secret path to her father’s mansion.”</p>

<p>Ruthelm, in descending the ladder, found infinitely more difficulty than
in his ascent: and several times his head turned giddy, and he was nearly
precipitated to the bottom of the ravine. When he reached Sibo’s castle,
he found the daughter in the arms of her father, who was weeping for
joy. <span class="smcap">Sibo</span>, from that moment, kept his gate open to every object of
distress—a practice which was continued by Ruthelm and Garlinda,
during a long series of years.</p>

<h5>MORAL.</h5>

<p>To counterpoise the baser passions and propensities of our nature, the
Omniscient Creator has implanted others in the human breast of an ennobling
kind. Thus charity and benevolence antagonise selfishness and
avarice. But these passions and propensities, good and bad, are not left
to contend with each other in anarchy, like jarring elements. Over them
is placed a power without passion, an emanation from the Deity, designed
to control the vicious and foster the virtuous workings of the spirit, either
by direct influence, or, which is more common, by nullifying the bad by
the good propensities.</p>

<p>It is this God-like <span class="smcap">Reason</span>, which distinguishes <span class="smcap">Man</span> from the
<span class="smcap">Brute</span> creation. The latter have but one governing passion or <span class="smcap">instinct</span>,
each, from which they cannot deviate, and which never fails to lead them
to their proper objects. But even in <span class="smcap">Man</span>, and especially in uncultivated
states of mind, <span class="smcap">Reason</span> is too often unequal to the governance of the
unruly passions, and requires the aid of another and higher power—<span class="smcap">Religion</span>.</p>

<p>Reason may, and too often does, err; but instinct is as undeviating in
its course as the earth in its revolutions round the sun. Whenever the
voice of Reason and the dictates of Religion are resisted, and ultimately
disregarded, some prominent passion from the vicious side of human
nature is sure to gain and to retain the mastery. The consequences need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
not be told! Every day that vice retains possession of the soul, diminishes
the chance of virtue regaining the ascendancy:—Hence the evil of
procrastination in the work of reformation!</p>

<p>But to return. Hospitality to the stranger, and charity to the indigent
are virtues so universally acknowledged, that few are bold enough to deny
them in theory, though there are many <span class="smcap">Sibos</span> who are chary of the practice.
The sums which were lavished on monasteries and convents, in
useless remorse, would have saved the Chieftain of Lorch many a bitter
hour of reflection, had they been judiciously applied to the relief of
penury and misfortune, before he was made to taste the bitter cup of
anguish himself!</p>

<p>The other part of the legend illustrates the well-known fact that—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Love will hope where Reason would despair.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And not only hope, but accomplish things apparently impossible of
achievement. Ruthelm was not the only one who has fallen in love of
unseen objects, and only known through pictorial or descriptive representations.
Few have passed the juvenile period of life without having
some imaginary goddess or hero in their thoughts, endowed with all the
virtues and charms which—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Youthful poets fancy when they love.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Whether time and experience have always <i>realized</i> (as Jonathan would
say) these golden dreams, can only be determined by the knowledge of
each individual.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Leaving Lorch, then, on our left, (in ascending the river) our attention
is strongly attracted to a renovated chateau on our right—<span class="smcap">Rheinstein</span>.
Here we must halt for a few minutes.</p>

<h4>THE BRIDAL OF RHEINSTEIN; OR, THE RUNAWAY MARRIAGE.<br />
(<i>Legend the Tenth.</i>)</h4>

<p>About midway between Lorch and Bingen, on our right hand, stands
the renovated castle of Rheinstein, on a romantic eminence, and very near
the Rhine. It is no longer a desolate pile of ruins, but the habitation
of a royal prince of Prussia, whose proud banner floats on its lofty
turret. No destructive missile or drawn sword now repels the inquisitive
stranger. The draw-bridge falls at the approach of Jew or Gentile, rich
or poor—and the renovated halls are thrown open to the inspection of all
visitors.</p>

<p>Tradition informs us that the original castle was inhabited by a Baron
Sifred, a dissolute young robber, who carried off from France, a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
maiden, and detained her in durance vile within his impregnable fortress.
The captivity of the lady, however, made a wonderful revolution in the
baron’s life. The noise of revelry and arms was superseded by the sounds
of the lute—and <span class="smcap">Yutta</span> became the bride of <span class="smcap">Sifred</span>. Twelve months of
love and happiness flew rapidly round, and Yutta presented her husband
with a pledge of their affection—a female child. The mother survived
the birth only a few hours. The baron shut himself up in his castle, and
dedicated his time to the education of his daughter.</p>

<p>Guerda grew up to the delight of her father’s declining years—and to
the relief of wandering pilgrims, who sought refuge in the castle, and who
sounded the fame of Guerda’s beauty far and near.</p>

<p>Hosts of suitors now flocked to the castle, but they were referred by
Sifred to an approaching tournament at Mayence, where his daughter
would select the most valiant knight. Her appearance at the assemblage
excited universal admiration; and two knights determined to win her
hand—Kuno of Reichenstein, and Conrad of Ehrenfels. The latter was
the elder, and of a fierce disposition—the former was evidently preferred
by the lady. Notwithstanding prodigies of valour, Kuno was defeated,
and Conrad claimed the hand of Guerda. The father received the victor
as his future son-in-law; while the dejected Kuno prepared to join an
expedition to Palestine. The hapless Guerda was overwhelmed with
grief; but her father was inexorable! The day of the nuptials was fixed—the
cavalcade, with Guerda, the pallid victim of parental tyranny,
mounted on a milk-white steed, proceeded towards the chapel, which was
midway between the castle of her father and that of Kuno of Reichenstein.
When near the sacred edifice, Guerda’s horse suddenly reared and
plunged, endangering the life of the bride. Conrad, while endeavouring
to seize the reins, received a dreadful kick from the furious steed, which
prostrated him on the ground. The animal immediately darted forward,
like an arrow from a bow, and never stopped till he carried the betrothed
to the very gate of Kuno’s castle. Her lover, who witnessed this exciting
scene, flew to the gate—gave admittance to Guerda—dropped the
portcullis—and secured the treasure! Conrad was killed by the blow
from the steed, and Sifred soon afterwards gave consent to the nuptials of
Kuno and Guerda.</p>

<p>Would that, in every mercenary and ill-assorted match, the bride were
mounted on so spirited and sensible a palfrey as that of Guerda, when
proceeding to the altar! The <i>runaway</i> marriage of Rheinstein was far
preferable to many of those slow and stately processions which attend the
contracts of fashionable modern life!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE RAT OR MOUSE-TOWER.<br />
(<i>Legend the Eleventh.</i>)</h4>

<p>It appears that there were corn-laws, or at least corn-monopolists, in
days of yore as well as now. A dignitary of the church (not <i>our</i> church),
the bishop of Mentz, had well-stored granaries, and fared sumptuously.
A time of scarcity arrived. The populace begged for bread; but the
bishop would only give them blessings. These would not fill the stomach,
and the clamour becoming louder, the bishop waxed wroth. He
flung open one of his granaries containing but little grain. The people
rushed in—he bolted the doors—and set fire to the building! Murder
will be out, sooner or later, and even punished in this world. The rats
and the mice took up the cause of their masters. They cut through the
floors and ceilings of the palace—nibbled holes in the arras—and poked
their little noses through to smell the fat bishop. This was notice to
quit, or furnish a cannibal supper for the unwelcome intruders.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent1">“They gnawed the arras above and beneath,</div>
<div class="verse">They ate each savoury dish up.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And shortly their sacrilegious teeth</div>
<div class="verse">Began to nibble the bishop!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The holy man betook himself to a tower in the middle of the Rhine;
(Tours des Rats) but the nimble little quadrupeds swam across in legions—scaled
the tower—and devoured the bishop!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">One morning his skeleton there was seen,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">By a load of flesh the lighter,</div>
<div class="verse">They had picked his bones uncommonly clean,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And eaten his very mitre!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The moral is good, though the tale is improbable. But if the <span class="smcap">Auto
da Fé</span> of the bishop was a romance, the atrocity of the action has too
often been surpassed even in our time—and that by “butcherly blockheads”
in the cause of bigotry and superstition, though in the name of
religion!</p>

<p>I suspect that the moral of the “Mouse or Rat Tower” lies much
deeper than is supposed. It seems to indicate that, although the rich and
the powerful may sometimes evade the law, they can never escape punishment.
The inward monitor cannot be stifled, cross what rivers, seas, or
mountains we may—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Cœlum non animum mutant</div>
<div class="verse indent5">qui trans mare currunt.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">which I would liberally translate thus:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">Vain hope! That “worm that never dies,”</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Preys on his vitals all unseen!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The mice were meant to represent the conscience of the cruel bishop,
from which, neither the streams of the Rhine nor the battlements of the
tower could protect him.</p>

<h4>CHANGE OF SCENE.</h4>

<p>After passing <span class="smcap">Bingen</span>, the poetry of the Rhine disappears—or sinks
into smooth but unimpassioned prose. The “castled crags” and precipitous
cliffs soften down into sloping glades and country villas—the river
widens, and becomes studded with innumerable islets, verdant to the
water’s edge—the majestic and romantic features of the scenery are
changed into the beautiful and the fertile—it is like turning from the
statues of Mars and Bellona to those of Cupid and Psyche! The legends
and tales vanish with the rocks and ruins where they had a “local habitation”—romance
degenerates into reality—the fervid imagination is
softened down into sober judgment—and the excitement of admiration
subsides into the tranquillity of reflection! The eye is spoiled for the
charms of the wide-spread Rhinegau, teeming with the grape, and with
every necessary of life; yet the landscape is loveliness itself. What it
has lost in sublimity, it has fully gained in beauty.</p>

<p>The sun had just set beneath the horizon, and while—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Twilight’s soft shades stole o’er the village green,</div>
<div class="verse">With magic tints to harmonize the scene,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">our contemplations were broken by the steamer suddenly sheering alongside
the jetty at Biberich, and discharging its cargo of human beings
close to the royal palace of Nassau. After the usual bustle attendant on
the transmigration of souls, bodies, and baggage, from water to land, we
were safely deposited, in less than an hour, at the Adler Hotel, within a
stone’s throw of the celebrated <span class="smcap">Kochbrunnen</span>, or chicken-broth distillery
at Wisbaden.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 id="WISBADEN">WISBADEN.</h3>

<p>This is one of the most celebrated spas in Germany—and more frequented,
as a <i>medicinal spa</i>, than any other by our countrymen and women.
It is only four miles from Biberich, near Mayence, and is very pleasantly
situated, with a ridge of the Taunus to the north-east, while the country
is open between it and the Rhine, in the opposite quarter. It is a very
handsome town, of seven or eight thousand souls, and the capital of the
duchy of Nassau. It is, itself, in a slight depression of the ground, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
not so much as to impede a free circulation of air. Wisbaden is healthy,
though rather warm, owing, probably, to the hot springs under the surface.
The temperature, however, renders it a good winter residence for
those who are unable or disinclined to seek the shores of Italy or other
southern localities. The neighbouring country produces all the necessaries
of life in abundance, and the vicinity of Frankfort, Mayence, and the
Rhine, secures it the luxuries, when required. Excellent water is conducted
from the Taunus for the use of the town. The <span class="smcap">Cursaal</span> is the
most magnificent in Europe—the hotels are numerous and good—the
walks and rides exceedingly varied, cheerful, and salubrious. There are
from ten to fifteen thousand annual spa-drinkers and bathers—while a far
greater number spend a short time at Wisbaden for pleasure. A considerable
number of the hotels have bathing establishments—the Eagle is
the oldest—and is well appointed. In turning up from this hotel towards
the Cursaal, we stumble on the <span class="smcap">Kochbrunnen</span>, (the scalding spring,) the
grand source of the drinking waters, and also of several baths. It has
rather a mean appearance, and the water looks rather of a greenish-yellow
colour, and seems turbid in the well, with a scum over a part of it, which
is called “<i>cream</i>,” and is considered by the chemists as a peculiar animal
or extractive matter, whose nature and source are unknown. The taste is
that of weak chicken-broth with rather too much salt. There are upwards
of nine hundred baths in the different establishments.</p>

<p>The plantations, extending from the back of the Cursaal to the old
ruin of Sonnenburg Castle, are very beautiful—and thence are paths cut
among the umbrageous woods to the <span class="smcap">Platte</span>, the Duke’s Summer-house,
on one of the mountains of Taunus, whence a magnificent view is obtained—Rhineward
and Inland.</p>

<p>The road to Schwalbach and Schlangenbad present fine airy drives and
walks over high, open, and unwooded grounds, communicating health
and vigour to the enfeebled frame.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, the Romans were well acquainted with Wisbaden,
and close to the Kochbrunnen, in the Romerbad, may be still seen the
remains of several Roman baths—and one in particular having two
springs of its own. But the monuments of antiquity in this place are
numerous.</p>

<p>Three grand theories respecting the causes and sources of thermal
springs divide the transcendental philosophers, naturalists, and physicians
of Germany. These are the electro-chemical—the volcanic—and the
vital. <span class="smcap">Wurzer</span> expresses the opinions of the first class thus:—“As
Nature is performing her operations in her immense laboratory, she has
here a <i>galvanic apparatus</i> of immense size. Extensive masses of mountains,
<i>perhaps</i> of unfathomable depth, <i>probably</i> form the individual plates
of this voltaic column.” This is tolerably bold. While Brand and
Faraday are dissolving metals by the tiny galvanic apparatus in Albemarle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Street, Nature is manufacturing mineral waters at Wisbaden, Ems, and
Carlsbad, on a magnificent scale! Lichtenberg, however, surpasses Wurzer
in the sublimity of his ideas on this subject.</p>

<p>“In the distilling operations of Nature, the belly of her retort sometimes
lies in Africa—its neck extending all over Europe—whilst its recipient
is in—Siberia.”!!</p>

<p>Bischoff, Struve, Kastner, and others, are more moderate in their
flights. They ascribe the origin of some thermal springs to volcanic
operations in the bowels of the earth—of other springs to the gradual
solution of their component parts in subterranean reservoirs.</p>

<p>The third class of philosophers have boldly cut the Gordian knot, instead
of untying it, and erected thermal springs and mineral waters generally
into <i>animated beings</i> which transfuse their vitality into the bodies of
the spa-drinkers, and thus cure all diseases!</p>

<p>“These and similar observations (says Dr. Peez, of Wisbaden,) compel
us to admit the existence of a <i>peculiar vital principle in mineral waters,
communicating to the human body either an attractive faculty more consonant
with the medicinal component parts of the water; or, acting by itself as a
healing power upon the diseased organism</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The <i>italics</i> are those of Dr. Peez, and not mine. German mysticism
could hardly be expected to go farther. But it has outdone itself, as the
following extract will shew:—</p>

<p>“The partial effect of the medicinal component parts of mineral waters
is pushed back, as it were, retreating under the ægis of a general power
which directly excites the autocracy of the animated animal body, and
<i>compels it to act according to the particular quality of the mineral spring
determined by its component parts</i>.”—(104.)</p>

<p>Here we have a good specimen of German ideality, and transcendental
mystification!<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>My friend, Dr. Granville, like every other man of genius, has a hankering
after a theory; but he was too shrewd not to see that this monstrous
German hypothesis of “vitality” would be too large even for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
swallow of John Bull. He has therefore substituted a much more rational
and intelligible reason for the effects of thermal spas—namely, their
<i>caloricity</i>, as differing materially from that of common water heated to
the same degree of temperature. It is very easy to conceive that cauldrons
that have been kept boiling in the bowels of the earth for thousands
of years, will have diffused the caloric more uniformly and minutely
through the waters, and dissolved more completely the mineral ingredients,
than pots and kettles in the laboratory of the chemist. This, in
all probability, is the solution of the mystery respecting the superior efficacy
of thermal spas.</p>

<p>The composition of the Kochbrunnen is as follows:—Forty-four grains
of common salt—five of muriate of lime—one and a half of carbonate of
lime, out of fifty-nine grains in the pint. The remaining nine grains are
not worth enumerating, as the salt and lime are clearly the main ingredients.
There are only seven cubic inches of carbonic acid gas in the
pint. The temperature is little short of 160° of Fahrenheit. Let us
begin with the baths. At a temperature of 86° to 90°, the bath generally
occasions a slight sensation of chilliness, which goes off in a few
minutes, and is succeeded by a feeling of comfort—serenity of mind—and
ultimately a degree of weariness or lassitude, inclining the bather to lie
quiet and repose himself. The volume of the body rather diminishes than
expands, and the skin of the hands and feet are gently corrugated—the
pulse becomes slower and softer—irritability is lessened—spasmodic feelings
(if they existed,) disappear under the soothing influence of the waters
on the nervous system and circulation—the functions of the intestinal
tube are encreased, as are those of the skin, kidneys, and various glandular
organs.</p>

<p>At a temperature of 94° to 98°, the bather, at the moment of immersion,
experiences an agreeable sense of warmth—the vital powers are exalted,
and all the functions of the organs are put into a state of increased
activity. The pulse expands and quickens, but is still soft—and all the
secretions and excretions are augmented after leaving the bath.</p>

<p>As the weight of the body is increased from half-a-pound to a pound
and a half, while immersed, there can be no doubt that a considerable absorption
takes place. At above 98°, or blood heat, the bath excites the
pulse and renders it both full and hard—embarrasses the breath—flushes
the face—reddens the whole surface of the body—excites perspiration—powerfully
draws the circulation to the skin—and not seldom causes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
head-aches, vertigo—and even apoplexy. Douches and shower-baths are
often ordered before the plunging or vapour-bath. Lavements of the spa-water
are also employed—and it is said with good effects, relieving the
stomach from the ingurgitation of so much fluid.</p>

<p>Preceding, and sometimes during the cure, the following phenomena
occur in a majority of cases, in addition to those already described:—viz.
a prostration of strength—headaches—giddiness—constriction over the
eyes—drowsiness. In some cases, there will be constipation—loaded
tongue—loss of appetite—oppression about the chest—feebleness of the
limbs—nervous irritability—disturbed sleep—perspiration—palpitations—eruptions
on the skin. These symptoms are acknowledged by the spa-practitioners
themselves to indicate an inconvenient use either of the baths
or the drink—or some abnormal susceptibility of the constitution—or
some impropriety of regime. They soon disappear by lessening the application
of the remedy, and taking some aperient medicine—an omission,
however, which most of the spa-doctors are sure to make, trusting, as
they do, almost entirely to the operation of the waters.</p>

<p>It is necessary to remark that, the rheumatic and gouty who resort to
these waters, (and they are by far the most numerous classes,) must expect
to suffer a considerable increase of their complaints at the commencement—amounting
often to acute pain and even inflammation of the parts
affected. The local medical authorities represent these as the sure precursors
of great relief, if not a radical cure of the maladies in question.
I would advise patients to be on their guard in this respect. The first
two individuals whom I fell in with at Wisbaden, and whom I formerly
attended, were in imminent danger of their lives, from the effects of
drinking and bathing in the waters. One was on the verge of apoplexy—and
the other in a fair way for a rheumatic fever. Both were soon
relieved by aperients, colchicum, and starvation.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>There is another class who experience no uncomfortable symptoms
during the use of the waters, which operate by the skin, the kidneys,
and the bowels—and these proceed quickly and favourably to a restoration
of health.</p>

<p>There is still a third class who experience no relief from the waters, but
rather an exasperation of all their maladies. The spa doctors give them
this consolation, that, long after their return to their homes, they will
probably get much better—or quite well! The following passage from
Dr. Peez, should awaken precaution.</p>

<p>“Let us now take into consideration a phenomenon we observe first
after patients have for some time been drinking, or bathing in, the thermal
water of Wisbaden, and which might alarm timorous minds. The reaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
taking place in the beginning of the patient’s making use of the
water, mentioned above, returns with <i>some individuals</i>. I have observed
this being the case particularly with females of a hysteric disposition, attended
with a <i>tendency</i> to hemorrhoïdal complaints, who, for that reason,
were very irritable. Bathing in, and drinking thermal water of this place
for a fortnight, three weeks, and longer, are extremely favorable,—each
day is attended with additional success: one ailment after the other disappears;
a pause then ensues, the irritability of the body rises—the patient’s
sleep grows restless; some complain of palpitating of the heart,
oppression of the chest, and slight vertigo. In this case it is necessary
to cease bathing, at least for some days, and to observe what nature
means by that excitation. This, however, commonly ceases in the course
of a few days, when the patient may again take the bath without hesitation,
and with advantage, provided he be careful to follow the direction of
his physician. Others, however, in that case have attained to the limits
of bathing, prescribed by nature, and if they obstinately transgress these
laws, their career on the road to recovery takes a retrograde turn. I have
seen such improvident bathers, who, not knowing the nature of these
phenomena, continued bathing without consulting their physician, were
seized with spasms, spitting of blood, and other ailments.”</p>

<p>It is remarked by Dr. Richter, that as the greater number of patients at
Wisbaden are afflicted with gouty or rheumatic complaints, so they must
expect to experience the specific effects of the waters more sensibly than
other people. It is not uncommon therefore for these to suffer, at the
beginning of the course, very high states of excitement, pain, and even
inflammation of the parts involved in the original malady. This may be
encouragement to perseverance; but it may also prove extremely hazardous.
The following case from Dr. Peez, will exemplify this remark.</p>

<p>“The abdomen of a lady aged 52 years, having been afflicted for a long
time with <i>plethora abdominalis</i>, began at last to swell and to grow hard,
her complexion being tinged with a greyish-yellow colour, whilst her organs
of digestion were impaired at the same time. She was particularly alarmed
by occasional palpitations of her heart, most commonly troubling her at
night, and obliging her to quit her bed. Having bathed in, and drunk,
our thermal water, the palpitations grew more violent, and rendered it
necessary that a small quantity of blood should be taken from her occasionally.”</p>

<p>In the third week of the course, she was seized with a copious <i>purgation</i>
of morbid secretions, when the palpitations vanished—the abdomen
became soft—the complexion cleared—and she was soon well.</p>

<p>Now it is clear that this good lady laboured under congestion of the
liver, jaundice, and loaded bowels. Nature rescued her from the heat of
the Kochbrunnen, by a process which ought to have been instituted three
weeks before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall endeavour to shew in other places, that these crises, spa-fevers,
bad-sturms, and re-actions, described by the foreign writers on the Spas,
are often attributable to the want of combining some mild mercurial alterative
and aperient with the use of the waters. Many cures are prevented
or rendered ineffectual by the dread of mercury entertained by the German
physicians.</p>

<p>The following <span class="smcap">auxilio-preservative</span> (if I may so term it), will be
found of essential service every night before taking the morning waters.</p>

<p>We shall now advert to the remarks of Dr. Richter, who has published
a very sensible little treatise on the Wisbaden waters, in the year 1839.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Group of Disorders in which the Waters, either Internal or
External, or both, are likely to be useful.</span></h4>

<p>1. <i>Complaints having their seat in the abdominal organs, and especially in
the biliary apparatus.</i>—The signs or indications of these are—acidities—eructations—furred
tongue—troubled digestion—loss of appetite—sense of
tightness or oppression about the stomach and bowels, after food—costiveness,
or relaxed bowels—congestion about the liver, with or without enlargement
of that organ—hypochondriasis and hysteria—hæmorrhoids and
their consequences—irritations about the kidneys and bladder—sequences
of residence in tropical climates.</p>

<p>2. <i>The various forms of gout and their sequences.</i>—Besides the regular
or periodical gout, Dr. Richter enumerates the multitudinous forms which
it assumes when latently preying on different organs and structures.
There is no end to the proteian features of masked gout—extending as
they do from the terrific lacerations of <span class="smcap">tic douloureux</span> down to the most
anomalous morbid feeling, whether internal or external. “In all these,”
D. R. avers, “the waters and baths of Wisbaden are eminently beneficial.”
The baths, when assisted by the internal use of the waters, bring anomalous
and latent gout into its proper place and form—into the extremities,
thus relieving the interior.</p>

<p>3. <i>Paralysis, general or local</i>—the sequence of apoplectic attacks, or
the consequences of metastases of gout, rheumatism, or cutaneous eruptions
from the surface to the brain or spine—also those paralytic affections
occasioned by the poisons of lead, arsenic, mercury, &amp;c. or contusions or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
other injuries of the head and back. Dr. Richter cautiously observes that,
during the use of the Wisbaden waters for the foregoing class of complaints,
it will often be necessary to bleed, cup, or leech, as well as to take
aperient medicines from time to time, under the guidance of the medical
attendant.</p>

<p>4. <i>Scrofulous complaints</i>, of all kinds and degrees.</p>

<p>5. <i>Rheumatism</i>, with its various consequences. Of course it is <i>chronic</i>
rheumatism that is here meant, with enlargements of joints, contractions,
effusions into the capsular ligaments, &amp;c. which attend on and follow that
painful class of diseases.</p>

<p>6. The <i>sequences of mercurial courses</i> for various diseases, both in this
country and between the tropics.</p>

<p>7. <i>Several pulmonary complaints</i>, occasioned by repressed gout, rheumatism
or cutaneous eruptions.</p>

<p>8. The Wisbaden waters (like many other mineral springs) are lauded
as efficacious in certain complaints and defects of both sexes, which it is
not convenient or proper to notice in this place.</p>

<h4>COUNTER-INDICATIONS.</h4>

<p>Dr. Richter dedicates a chapter to those complaints which are not
benefited, but injured by the waters of Wisbaden.</p>

<p>1. All <i>acute</i> diseases—that is to say, diseases accompanied by fever or
inflammation, are totally and entirely prohibited from these waters. But
this is not all. Wherever there is febrile action in the constitution, or
local inflammation, however subacute, or even chronic, the use of thermal
springs, either as drink or baths—but especially the baths—is dangerous.
“These waters, internal and external, will excite the circulation and
nervous system (already too much exalted) into the most dangerous reactions,
and lead to the most deplorable consequences.” P. 43.</p>

<p>Phthisical affections, except in the earliest stage, and before any material
change has taken place in the lungs, preclude the idea of utility from
these waters. Emaciation, from internal suppuration in any organ, and
resembling phthisis, forbids the waters of Wisbaden. The same may be
said of cachectic habits, where the blood is broken down, and the solids
wasted. Dropsy of the chest, abdomen, or skin will be prejudiced by
these sources—and in short, all diseases connected with, or dependent on
defect of vital energy; or, in other words, debility of constitution generally.
Catarrhal affections of kidneys and bladder—fluor albus—severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
derangement of the digestive organs, (grand derangement des organs de
la digestion)—chronic diarrhœa, &amp;c. with emaciation, will derive no benefit
but injury from these waters. All tendency to spitting of blood—all
enlargements of the glandular abdominal organs with debility and wasting,
prohibit the use of Wisbaden waters. The same holds good with
respect to stony concretions in the kidneys or bladder—biliary concretions
in the gall-bladder or ducts—scirrhous formations in any of the organs of
the interior, or exterior parts—all organic affections of the heart or large
vessels—epilepsy—catalepsy—St. Vitus’s dance—very inveterate forms
of gout, with chalk-stones, paralytic lameness, and considerable debility.
In some of these last cases, Dr. R. thinks that, when directed with skill
and caution, the waters may afford some relief though nothing like a cure.
Sterility, with constitutional exhaustion and debility, has little to hope
from Wisbaden.</p>

<p>The reader will here perceive a long list of maladies which the Wisbaden
waters will not cure, but aggravate. It is very rare for a spa-doctor
to offer any such list. Their springs are panaceas for all the ills to which
flesh is heir. There is a passage in Dr. Peez’s work respecting the baths
which deserves attention. He remarks that there is a point of <i>saturation</i>
in the use of thermal waters, beyond which it is dangerous to proceed.
But this point of saturation is difficult to ascertain. The following is not
very consolatory.</p>

<p>“The temperature of the bath must be made to correspond as exactly
as possible with their individuality. Baths that are but <i>one</i> degree too
warm or too cool, will very soon produce the point of saturation. Neither
is it advisable that such a person should bathe daily, nor, in the beginning,
stay in the bath longer than 15-25 minutes: for his great irritability
very easily provokes in the very beginning those excitations that are
the forerunners of critical secretions and accelerate the appearance of the
symptoms of overbathing, and if the patient be not exposed to the danger
of a violent artificial fever, the success of his cure is, at least, rendered
very doubtful. He is, in this case, obliged to discontinue bathing so long
that the time intended to have been spent in bathing passes, or must be
prolonged considerably.” 161.</p>

<p>In many people this critical point of <i>saturation</i> is announced by very
restless sleep, disturbed by dreams—or somnolency by day—tenderness of
the eye to light—uneasiness, despondency, and anxiety, without any
adequate cause—derangement of the digestion—loaded tongue. If these
symptoms be overlooked or disregarded, phenomena of more importance
present themselves, such as palpitations—difficulty of breathing—profuse
sweats—nausea—and finally a fever. Dr. P. is very averse to any
active remedies to reduce the fever of over-bathing, and especially bleeding
or purging. He advises that nothing be done but to desist from bathing,
and to take some cooling acidulous waters, as those of Selters or Fackingen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>The same author assures us that the Wisbaden waters are extremely
easy of digestion—that they improve the appetite—open the bowels, in a
majority of cases—are eminently diuretic—but occasionally produce constipation.
From all that I could observe myself, these waters have very
little aperient effect.</p>

<p>To enumerate the diseases for which the Wisbaden waters are renowned
would require a small volume—at least according to the testimony of
Peez. In one word, they cure all diseases in general, and many others
in particular!! On looking over the works of spa-doctors, we must come
to one or other of the following conclusions, viz. there must either be a
universal conspiracy among the faculty of Europe against spas, and in
favour of their own monopoly of thinning the ranks of the population by
physic—or the world is deaf to the entreaties of the water-doctors, and
desire not to be cured—or, what is not quite impossible, the virtues of
mineral waters are a little too much extolled by those who have the administration
of them. It is perhaps fortunate for the world that one or
other of these prejudices or infatuations prevail—otherwise there would
be no bills of mortality—no doctors—no undertakers—in short, man
would be immortal even in this world!</p>

<p>There will still be a considerable number, however, of afflicted beings
who will not despise the blessings so freely and so cheaply offered by the
high priests of Hygeia.</p>

<p>It is pretty well known that a kind of monomania prevails among all
classes on the Continent respecting hæmorrhoids—a complaint almost as
much dreaded by the English as it is courted by foreigners. By the people
it is considered quite a god-send—the absence of it being a calamity,
and its presence a talisman against every malady—by the physician, its
sanative powers are represented as only inferior to the waters of Wisbaden,
Kissengen, or Carlsbad. By the physiologist and pathologist hæmorrhoids
are calculated to bear the same relation to the constitution that the
safety-valve does to the steam-engine. Without the one, the boiler would
burst—without the other the German would die. In a word, the German
had rather live without his pipe, than without his piles!</p>

<p>To the deficiency, absence, or interruption of hæmorrhoids are attributed
chiefly all those obstructions of the abdominal viscera which lead to dropsy
and other fatal diseases. The waters of Wisbaden are represented as
having the normal or salutary power of restraining piles, when in excess—encouraging
them when languid—and reproducing them when accidentally
arrested. <span class="smcap">Hypochondriasis</span> is one of the grand forms in which
suppressed hæmorrhoids harasses the patient for years, according to the
continental pathology.</p>

<p>“How often,” says Dr. Peez, “does it, however, happen, that an abdominal
disease exclusively confined to the nervous system, suddenly
changes its character, preferably affecting the bloodvessels, and thus is
transformed into an active hemorrhoïdal disorder!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have had occasion to observe the case of a husbandman, who had
been suffering the torments of hypochondria for some years; he was
emaciated and ill fed. His means did not allow him to attempt a radical
cure, and he applied only from time to time for my assistance, when his
sufferings were most painful. In spring 1821 he was suddenly seized with
palpitations of the heart, and when these ceased, his pulse continued for
some months to be full and hard, as in the case of fever. Discerning the
character of his disorder, I made him come to Wisbaden. Here he took
half-baths, drank the water in copious doses, and was cupped in his legs
several times. In twelve days the hemorrhoïds declared themselves in the
usual shape and delivered him from his melancholy, anxiety, and oppression
of the stomach, which had tormented him so long.” 196.</p>

<p>Dr. Peez informs us that the sequences of tropical diseases are radically
cured by the Wisbaden springs.</p>

<p>“Among the consequences of these endemic diseases of the Indies we
must reckon: tumefactions of the liver, and the spleen, which frequently
are encomous, as well as other tumors in the cavity of the abdomen:
swellings and obstructions of the intestinal glands (which frequently also
are the products of malignant cutaneous diseases, peculiar to the torrid
zone), obstinate jaundice, spasms of the stomach, accompanied with a
vomiting of food.</p>

<p>“The English and Dutch physicians have these many years been in the
habit of sending patients of this class to Carlsbad or Wisbaden, after those
of the former first had tried Cheltenham to no purpose; and these two
springs produce, in the above mentioned diseases, an effect really wonderful.”
198.</p>

<p>Now we were told by the more cautious and candid Dr. Richter, a page
or two back, that “all enlargements of the glandular abdominal organs,
with debility,” were diseases not to be remedied by these waters. All
these morbid growths are attended and nourished by more or less of chronic
inflammation, and in these cases the Wisbaden, or any other thermal baths,
are more likely to do harm than good. The aperient waters of Kissengen
or Pulna are far more efficacious and safe. Dr. P. has a chapter on
the efficacy of these waters in “paralysis the consequence of apoplexy.”
Now every physician knows that the cause of the paralysis succeeding
apoplexy is the clot of blood effused in the attack, and the damage which
the brain has received in the neighbourhood of that clot. Nature, at
length, absorbs the effused blood, or surrounds it with a sac, and then the
adjacent brain gradually recovers its function, if within the power of
nature, and the motion of the paralyzed limb is regained in proportion.
How this salutary process is to be accelerated by the baths or waters of
Wisbaden, I cannot imagine; but I can very easily conceive that these
warm baths may readily interrupt the work of nature, and convert a paralysis
into an apoplexy. Such conversions, in fact, do occur every year at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the German thermal spas. He says, “paralysis arising from <i>plethora</i> will
be cured with more facility by means of the thermal waters, than that
which is caused by the accumulation of lymph in the brain or the spinal
marrow.” This doctrine may be true in one sense, but it is dangerous in
another. Paralysis from plethora is undoubtedly more susceptible of
cure than dropsy of the brain or spine; but it must be a most hazardous
attempt to try the waters of Wisbaden for plethora of the brain or
spinal-marrow.</p>

<p>Our author’s directions for using the waters appear unobjectionable, and
therefore I shall cull out some of his chief rules.</p>

<p>1. The waters ought to be drunk fasting, and before the bath—using
gentle exercise and cheerful conversation between each draught. The
cup should never be emptied at once, but sipped slowly. Some people
may drink four hours after dinner, but in less quantities and at a lower
temperature.</p>

<p>In gouty affections, and where the skin is torpid, the water should be
drunk as hot as possible—and even in bed, if necessary. Some find it
better to drink it luke-warm, and mixed with a little milk. Half an hour
after finishing the waters, breakfast, (chocolate, coffee, or egg-milk, or
broth with the yolk of an egg,) may be taken. “The less nourishment
that is taken between drinking and bathing the better.” Half an hour or
an hour should elapse even after the lightest breakfast, before the bath.
It is dangerous to bathe when heated or perspiring. “Persons taking a
whole bath, should immerse themselves into the water only by slow degrees,
up to the neck, having previously sponged the chest and abdomen
with the bath water.” If seized with headache or vertigo in the bath, it
is too hot, and ought to be left immediately. Baths in which you perspire
are too hot, spoil the appetite, weaken the patient, and put him out
of humour all day. “All baths, even those of common water—sometimes
cause a sensible congestion of blood in the head.” The head should then
be sponged with cold water. Great care should be taken to avoid sleep in
the bath—or even after a hot bath—but after a tepid bath it may be allowed.</p>

<p>In many cases it is very beneficial to use friction, by means of a brush
or sponge, whilst in the bath. The duration of the bath is a quarter of
an hour to an hour and a half. People should always begin with the
short period—and not too high a temperature. Where it is desirable
to encourage gentle perspiration after the bath, the patient should go to bed.</p>

<p>As all sudden extremes are repugnant to nature, invalids, when travelling
towards watering-places, should begin to adopt the regimen and
hours which they must follow at the spas. A few tepid baths of plain
water are useful preparations, and light cooling diet, should be employed
for a week or two before arriving at the spa.</p>

<p>The following sketch of the motives, hopes, and prospects which lead
invalids to spas—and their routine of life and enjoyments at those places,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
is drawn by a <span class="smcap">Spa Doctor</span> of twenty years’ standing. It is nearly free
from the sins of commission—but not of <i>omission</i>. It is penned <i>en couleur
de rose</i>—and, like the speech of an advocate, it slurs over all features of
the case that might seem disadvantageous to the cause of the client.
I shall supply some deficiencies at the end.</p>

<p>“It is owing, in a great measure, to the enlivening influence which a
temporary residence at some watering-place exercises on the mind of the
visitor, that the most successful results are obtained there, and which the
best endeavours of the regular physician can seldom effect at home.</p>

<p>“Persons not labouring under serious disorders—such as men of business,
who purpose only to repose from the fatigues with which the performance
of their official duties is attended, and to partake of the amusements
afforded by bathing-places—the man of letters, who takes refuge
in them for relaxation from his serious studies;—the tender mother,
resorting to them to obtain relief for a beloved daughter—all these
have disengaged themselves, as much as possible, from the trammels of
their professional and domestic occupations and relations, and enter this
new world with renovated spirits. The cheerful and gay life of a bathing-establishment
presents to all of them charms with which they were
entirely unacquainted before. Individuals of all ranks, gathering there
from neighbouring parts and the most distant countries, united there
within narrow confines, mostly for one and the same purpose, meet for
the first time in that motley assemblage, and also hail each other, perhaps,
for the last time, for a long series of years. This variety, this contact of
individuals, frequently distinguished by high rank and eminent talents
and accomplishments, enhances the charms of indiscriminate social intercourse,
and adds an additional value even to the patient’s solitary hours,
as I have frequently experienced myself, by ushering in the dawn of a
happier futurity.</p>

<p>“The variety of interesting objects that present themselves to his view,
attracts his attention, and occupies his eyes and imagination, and kindred
spirits find many opportunities at watering-places to meet and to form
familiar connexions. A common purpose, the same society, the participation
of the same amusements and pleasures, facilitate the formation of
many interesting connexions. The opportunities of mutual intercourse
are numerous: the social meetings are not hampered by the trammels of
ceremony, and we readily acknowledge and enjoy mental and social talents
wherever we meet with them.</p>

<p>“The patients meet early in the morning on the public walks and at
the wells. There they interchange their wishes and hopes of recovery.
Many are on the eve of returning health; and, encouraged by the improving
state of convalescents whom they daily see, or by the perception
of encreasing strength, feel themselves elated with the pleasing hope of
experiencing in their own persons the successful results of bathing which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
they behold in others. New hopes awake in others that are still groaning
under the burden of severe and painful disorders, when they hear many
of their acquaintances bless the beneficent spring that has restored to them
health and the means of enjoying life.</p>

<p>“Here plans for the amusements of the day are discussed, appointments
for shorter or longer excursions made, according to the strength and inclination
of each individual; and these excursions, this enjoyment of the
open air, contribute a great deal to heighten the salubrious efficacy of the
wells. A cheerful mind exercises the most happy influence on the body,
and who could indulge his melancholy bent and remain a cool observer
amidst the charms of nature and in the society of persons that are endeavouring
to enjoy them?</p>

<p>“Now the patient takes the bath, and is happy to remain in the congenial
fluid to which earth communicates her vital warmth; he feels himself
strained more closely to the bosom of our common mother, whilst he is
surrounded by the salubrious liquid, issuing from her womb, and joyfully
presages the tendency of her mysterious powers.</p>

<p>“After the bath the patient regularly indulges himself with a few hours
of rest, which affords him additional enjoyment. He notes down what
he has seen and heard, reads, writes, or directs his steps to the colonnade
of the <i>Cursaal</i>, (pump-room,) where a select band of performers on wind
instruments gives an additional zest to the charms of the morning hours,
until the company meet in the dining-hall, where they sit down to a comfortable
dinner, seasoned by the sweet sounds of excellent music.</p>

<p>“Happy would it be if temperance and a sensible conversation did
always characterise these meals, and if all would be mindful, that the
offended Naiad severely punishes all kinds of excess, by which the strict
regimen she requires, is profaned!</p>

<p>“In the afternoon the plans formed in the morning are executed, each
patient trying the strength he has regained;—and, in the evening, the
lovers of dancing repair to Terpsichore’s temple; whilst others spend the
evening in one of the parties that are formed in every bathing establishment.
After the fatigues of the day, a balmy sleep, which is interrupted
no more by restlessness, improves the encreasing strength, and the dreams
that formerly were the mirrors of a melancholy reality, are superseded by
cheerful sports of fancy.</p>

<p>“These are the general outlines of a life that may be led at a much-frequented
watering-place, and by many is realized in a shape still more
pleasing and refined. The great diversity of enjoyments that may be procured
at these places, allots to each as much as he may want, and sometimes
even more than many a one desires.”<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>But is there no drawback on this scene of sunshine? Do all experience
the invigorating influence of returning health? No. Not one half! Do
the hypochondriacs who resort to Wisbaden in shoals, throw off their load
of mental despondency and bodily infirmities? Let Dr. Granville, who is
not inclined to depreciate spas in general—and “<span class="smcap">Spas of Germany</span>” in
particular, decide the question.</p>

<p>“What a dreadful picture of human wretchedness the hypochondriac
at Wiesbaden presents! He is sombre, thoughtful, or absent, in the
midst of a laughing world. For ever brooding over his fate, his disease
absorbs the whole of his attention. He disdains even the most trifling
conversation with his fellow-creatures, and flies from those ephemeral
acquaintances which are so easily formed at watering-places, exactly because
one cares little how soon after they are forgotten. In fact, he
would feel himself alone in the world, and never concern himself about
those around him, did he not envy their healthy looks, their firmer muscles,
and their sounder stomachs, which can sustain an indigestion with impunity!”</p>

<p>There are a great many others, besides hypochondriacs, who are destined
to feel the melancholy effects of blighted hopes in these last resorts
of suffering—and who turn their weary steps homewards, without the
cheering expectations that gilded their journey to a foreign land!</p>

<p>But is there no risk of receiving, in exchange for dear-bought health,
a moral contagion that poisons the springs of life, and saps the foundation
of every virtue? Beneath the gilded domes of that splendid mansion—that
palace of Plutus—that <span class="smcap">Cursaal</span>, or <i>Curst Hell</i>—the dæmons of
play exhibit their piles of glittering ore—those “irritamenta malorum—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">familiarizing the uninitiated eye to scenes of desperate speculation—imbuing
the soul with the wicked thirst of gold unjustly acquired—of plunder,
without fear of punishment—of robbery, without danger of the gallows!
The atmosphere of this Pandemonium—for the devils are in legions here—is
too infectious to be long resisted. The open manner in which the vice
is practised by day, and by night—in the presence of multitudes of all
ages, nations, and both sexes—on the sabbath of the Lord, as well as on
the day of work—this legalization, not merely permission of a violation of
morality, religion, and social order, which, in England, must skulk in holes
and corners—the kind of social heroism with which the most destructive
vicissitudes of fortune are borne by some of the hardened haunters of these
splendid hells—these and various other circumstances combine to mask the
hideous mien of the monster, and strip the crime itself of half its horrors,
till, by daily presentation, it becomes at length endurable without terror,
and embraced without remorse! The neophyte has no sooner wound up his
courage to the staking of his piece of gold, than the spell of security is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
broken—the charm of serenity is dissolved—the flood-gate of the passions
is thrown open—the “<i>auri sacra fames</i>” takes possession of the soul—and
the dæmon of the night enrols one more name on the list of his
victims!</p>

<p>The Spartan practice of exhibiting the drunken slave to disgust the
rising generation with the vice of inebriety, was a doubtful experiment at
best—but, in the present case, there can be no doubt at all as to its inapplicability.
There is always seen a certain proportion of the fair sex
round the gambling-tables—many of them playing with quite as much
desperation as the men. It is melancholy to state that, we too often see
delicate English females squeezing in between parded Jew and whiskered
German, to stake their gold or silver on the gyrations of a ball or the
colour of a card!</p>

<p>Here is an excellent <span class="smcap">normal school</span>, where the wives, and daughters,
and sons of our nobility and gentry can learn the rudiments—“<i>and something
more</i>”—of heartless vice and headlong dissipation, without reference
to sectarian creed, theological faith, or national religion;—while the children
of the Protestant peasant and mechanic would be contaminated by
the presence of Catholic or Dissenter in the same grammar-school, when
acquiring the rudiments of reading and writing! If this be not “straining
at gnats and swallowing camels,” I know not what is!</p>

<p>And here I may glance at a curious species of one-sided morality strictly
enforced by the late Duke of Nassau—the prohibition of gambling in the
“<span class="smcap">curst-hells</span>,” among his own subjects; while free permission is given
to all foreigners to rob and plunder each other at roulette and rouge et
noir, in the open day—Sundays and Saturdays! When I said <i>free</i> permission,
I was wrong. The license to gamble is sold to the bankers of
each Cursaal (curst hell) for a large sum—which goes into the ducal treasury.
I puzzled my brains, for a long time, in the attempt to discover the
<i>principle</i> of this law, and at length found it, as far off as China. The
geographers of that country represent the Celestial Empire as occupying
nearly the whole of the dry land of this globe—the various other countries
of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, being located as small islands
dotted in the ocean, and inhabited by <span class="smcap">barbarians</span>. Now it is clear that
the late Duke considered his Duchy of Nassau as the Celestial Empire of
Europe, the other nations, as Russia, Prussia, Austria, Italy, Spain, England,
America, &amp;c. being mere barbarians, whose morals were not worth
preserving—whose souls were not worth saving—and whose gold alone
was worth gathering into the royal exchequer at Biberich!<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>The young sovereign of Nassau has now a good opportunity of signalizing
his accession to power by abolishing the gambling tables of the
Cursaals. The income derived from the licensing of “hells” cannot yield
good interest here or hereafter.</p>

<h4>THE ADLER, OR EAGLE BATH.</h4>

<p>It is not my custom to entertain my readers with the names of hotels,
the prices of wines, or the hours of table-d’hôtes. These pieces of information
I leave for others. The present anecdote is an exception to the
general rule. Having arrived late at Wisbaden, we put up at the nearest
hotel, which was the Adler, or Eagle, the one where Dr. Granville resided,
and the locality of which is not considered the very best by him. We
found it a very good hotel, and well supplied with excellent baths. Early
next morning, my friend Mr. Cooper, of Brentford, and myself, took out our
tickets from the “<span class="smcap">Bade-maitre</span>” in the hall, and strolled round the establishment,
without meeting with any person whatever. As several of the
baths were standing open, we went into the first two that struck our fancy,
and bathed. I observed an unusual quantity of the scum or cream on the
surface of mine, and which I could have dispensed with. I took the opportunity,
however, of examining this cream, by means of four out of the
five senses, viz. by sight, touch, taste, and smell. Before I left the bath I
came to a conclusion as to its nature and origin. I have not a doubt that,
at the great deluge, an immense posse of white antediluvian bears, then as
large as elephants, were swept from the polar regions, and hurled headlong
into the great cauldron beneath Wisbaden. There they have been simmering
from the days of Noah—their flesh, fat, and marrow oozing up
daily, in the shape of cream or bear’s grease, as well as broth, through the
Kochbrunnen, greatly to the advantage of the Wisbadenites, and the benefit
of those afflicted with gout, rheumatism, and the stiff-joints of old age.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
I am astonished that Dr. Granville and Sir Francis Head should have
framed so puny an hypothesis as that of the <span class="smcap">Kochbrunnen</span> and <span class="smcap">Chicken-broth</span>.
Why, I appeal to every one who has travelled in Germany,
whether it would be possible to extract an ounce of fat from all the cocks,
hens, and chickens in Nassau, even if stewed in a Papin’s digester for six
months together. No, no. The cream and broth of the Kochbrunnen are
the veritable essence and decoction of the antediluvian bear, spiced perhaps
with a sprinkling of the “organic remains” of wolves, tigers, jackalls,
hyenas, and other small gear.</p>

<p>While I was dressing after my dip in this delectable soup, and carrying
out the details of my theory, a series of heavy blows and unintelligible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
vociferations at the door, induced me to think that the hotel was on fire, or
that the Kochbrunnen had exploded. I hastily drew the bolt, when in
rushed the infuriated bath-master’s cad, with his Medusa-faced cadess,
breathing forth all kinds of imprecations on my devoted head; and, from
their gestures and actions, menacing me with a drowning instead of a
plunging bath! I instantly threw myself into a posture of defence, determined,
if I must drink the bear’s broth again, that the cad or his gentle
mate should have the first gulp. On seeing this, they retreated a few feet
but still kept up a roar of abuse, till I had finished dressing, when my
friend Cooper joined in the affray. The assailants followed us, till I had
nearly got to the bad-master’s office, where, opening one of Dr. Granville’s
volumes, which I had under my arm, I pointed out the notice (not too
favourable) which had been already taken of the Adler, and told him that
I, too, was a <span class="smcap">spa-tourist</span>, and would render his baths either famous or
infamous, by the portrait which I should draw of them, as a warning to
my countrymen. The bath-master was astonished, and not a little terrified.
He immediately summoned his cad and cadess, informing them that
the English gentleman was an <span class="smcap">author</span>, and threatened to publish in
England an unfavourable account of the hotel and baths. The “<i>cream</i>”
of the jest soon came out. It appeared that a dandy of sixty—a Cupid
of the grand climacteric, had occupied for the season the bath which I
used, taking care that the water should be turned in over night, in order
that the cream, or bear’s grease, should have time for concretion on the
surface, and thus “smoothe the wrinkled brow,” as well as lubricate the
unpliant joints, of this veteran Adonis. The denouement disarmed me of
my wrath, especially when I recollected that, in this land of minute
regulations, I ought not to have descended into a vacant bath, without the
express sanction of the bad-master’s cad, in the subterranean regions. The
hotel itself is a very excellent one, and its master, who speaks English, a
very civil and obliging host. I recommend it to my countrymen, with this
proviso, that they never go into a bath that has an unusual proportion of
bear’s grease on the surface, without the cad’s permission, lest they spoil
the watery mirroir of some antiquated Narcissus, who hopes—vain hope!—by
means of baths and broths, to relume the lack-lustre eye—to efface
the time-ploughed furrows from the faded cheek—to communicate elasticity
to the indurated muscle—vital heat to the stagnant veins—activity to the
body, and energy to the mind:—and all these, <i>after</i> the allotted hours of
human existence have danced their giddy rounds<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>—after the cup of enjoyment
has over-flowed, times without number, and is now drained to the
dregs—<i>after</i>,</p>

<p class="noindent">has begun to afford feeble shelter against the storms of moral adversity,
and the stings of physical infirmity—<i>after</i> the discovery of Solomon, that
“all is vanity,” has been amply verified! That humanity should still
cling fondly to the cheerful clay, <i>after</i> all these warnings, is not wonderful,
because it is the natural impulse and instinct of every animated being,
from the gnat to the elephant. But that reasoning man, and woman too,
should attempt, not merely to conceal the ravages of time, but deck them
out in the false colours of youth, is a mortifying reflection and preposterous
exhibition! We see it however, every day—and the Adonis of the Adler
is an exquisite specimen.</p>

<p>I shall close this Chapter with an extract from a little work on the Spas
of Nassau, published in 1839, by my friend Mr. Lee, who practised three
years at Wisbaden, and made himself well acquainted with the remedial
efficacy of these waters.</p>

<p>“It is becoming evident in England, that the high reputation which
the Wisbaden springs have always enjoyed, for the cure and relief of gouty
and rheumatic affections, has not been over estimated, from the numbers
who annually return home in an improved state, several of whom having
for years been subject to repeated attacks of gout, have escaped any recurrence
after a course of the baths, during the whole winter and spring,
and have returned in subsequent seasons greatly improved in appearance,
more for the purpose of more effectually preserving themselves from a
relapse, than from any actual necessity. In cases of long standing, of the
atonic kind, with or without deposition of calcareous matter in the joints,
occurring in persons beyond the middle period of life, the Wisbaden baths
are calculated to render the most eminent service; indeed, according to
Dr. Peez, the more inveterate the gout is, the more effectually can it be
combated by these waters. Though bathing is the essential part of the
treatment, it is advisable in most of these cases to combine with it the
internal use of the water. Mild douching will also tend very much to the
dispersion of local swellings, puffiness, stiffness of the joints, of the wrist,
fingers or foot, and also of chalky concretions, <i>although it should not be
used if there be a tendency to inflammatory action, nor until a certain number
of baths have been taken</i>. During an attack, the baths will require to be
suspended, till the more severe symptoms have subsided; when the patient
may again begin, by previously drinking the water, while confined to his
room. In general, patients who have been accustomed to free living do
not bear a low regimen, and will be the better, after the inflammatory
symptoms are allayed, for being allowed some solid food if an inclination
be felt for it; care being taken, that the quality be plain and light, and
that the quantity be small. In cases of erratic, irregular, or repelled gout,
these baths will also most probably be productive of great benefit, and not
unfrequently cause the morbid action to restrict itself to one spot; a more
regular attack being sometimes induced, previous to an amelioration taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
place. Persons who have only experienced two or three attacks, but in
whom the predisposition is strong, may generally expect to derive permanent
benefit from the baths; provided they are subsequently cautious
in their mode of living, and do not indulge too freely in the pleasures of
the table; on the other hand, where there is much tendency to acute inflammation,
in persons of a plethoric or highly irritable habit, I should
consider Wisbaden less likely to suit than a warm alkaline spring, as Vichy
or Teplitz. I should be inclined also to counsel many young persons, in
whom the gout developed itself at an early age, in consequence of a
strong hereditary tendence, to give the preference to a spring of this kind;
though it is probable that they would equally derive advantage from Wisbaden.
It cannot be expected however, that a single course of the waters
would suffice to eradicate the disease; and, in order to have the chance
of a permanent cure, persons afflicted with gout would do well to return,
for two or three consecutive seasons, to the springs from which they derived
benefit; passing the intervening months in a suitable climate, and
paying attention to the regulation of their diet and mode of living.</p>

<p>“As the mornings are frequently chilly, and it is of importance to
prevent the action of a cold atmosphere on the surface of the body, while
under a course of bathing, I do not in general recommend, to English
patients, the very early hours of rising and drinking the water, adopted
by the Germans; six, or half-past, will be sufficiently early, even for
those who take their bath before breakfast, and for those who do not, any
time between that hour and half-past seven; breakfast being taken an
hour after drinking, and consisting of tea or coffee, according as the one
or other is found best to agree. Those who dine at one o’clock, should
again drink about seven in the evening; while for those persons who
prefer dining at four, or later, from two to three will be the best time for
taking their second dose. The effects of the water are thus better sustained
than when the whole quantity prescribed is taken in the morning,
and an interval of four-and-twenty hours allowed to elapse between the
periods of drinking; the water is often thus better digested, and is well
borne, when the distention of the stomach by the same quantity if taken
before breakfast, would disagree and give rise to unpleasant symptoms,
or occasion a too active operation upon the bowels or kidneys.—It is
also advisable, when a full course of these and other mineral waters is
required, to recommend a temporary suspension of the course, and change
of air for three or four days, after a certain period of drinking and bathing
has elapsed; by this means, the system is not too early saturated, and the
patient returns to resume the use of the water, in a more fit state for its
absorption, and with a greater probability of more durable benefit.</p>

<p>“Most chronic rheumatic affections will be removed or greatly relieved
by the Wisbaden baths. In the slighter cases, not of long standing, a
short course, for about three weeks, will be frequently sufficient. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
more intractable cases of articular and muscular rheumatism, as also in
the pains of a rheumatic nature affecting the face, head, and other parts;
a more prolonged course will often be required, combined with the use of
the douche. In some cases the hot bath, vapour-bath, or douche, may be
advantageously employed, especially in elderly persons whose skin is dry,
and seldom perspirable. Where however the complaint has supervened
upon, or has been continued from an acute attack, in which any symptoms
of the heart or pericardium being affected, were present—which is more
frequently the case than is generally supposed—it would be well to ascertain,
by auscultation and percussion, that none of those symptoms remain,
as they would very likely be aggravated by the employment of the water.
Those rheumatic affections depending upon long exposure to wet or cold,
to which military men on duty are peculiarly subject, are especially relieved
by these baths. Two or three bad cases of this kind fell under my
observation last year, in which the most beneficial and unexpected results
followed a full course of the waters. One gentleman in particular who
returned from India invalided, was scarcely able to get about with the
assistance of a stick; who was sceptical of the power of mineral waters,
and not over-attentive with respect to his diet, recovered the comparatively
free use of his limbs before he left Wisbaden, and was completely
restored when I met him about a month afterwards, in a steamer on the
Mediterranean, being on his way to rejoin his regiment.”</p>

<p>“Those nervous pains recurring in paroxysms affecting the branches
of particular nerves of the face, head, or extremities, to which the term
neuralgia or tic is generally applied, and which not unfrequently originate
from a rheumatic or gouty diathesis, from the suppression of habitual discharges,
or of cutaneous eruptions—which causes, though perhaps somewhat
exaggerated by continental practitioners, are not sufficiently attended
to in England—are more likely to be relieved and cured by a properly
directed course of mineral waters, than by pharmaceutical remedies or
local applications. To many of these cases Wisbaden would be exceedingly
applicable, especially when the functions of the skin are sluggishly
performed, and there exists a congested state of the abdominal or pelvic
viscera, with retardation or irregularity of the periodical secretion in
females. In those cases which appear to arise from other causes, as moral
influences, a high state of nervous excitability, &amp;c., I should be more inclined
to recommend waters of a different kind, of which I shall have to
speak presently. Water or vapour douches may in general be advantageously
combined with the baths and the internal use of the same water—or
of a water of a different nature, as that of Homburg, Marienbad, &amp;c.
according as circumstances may seem to indicate their employment.</p>

<p>“The state of abdominal plethora, with congestion of the liver, and
obstruction in the circulation of the vena portæ, termed by the Germans
<i>Unterleibsvollblütigkeit</i>, with its consequences, as impaired digestion, deficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
or vitiated biliary secretion, piles, &amp;c.—occurring for the most part
in persons about or beyond the middle period of life, who have been
addicted to the pleasures of the table, and marked by more or less protuberance
of the abdomen, with diminished muscular and nervous energy—is
one well calculated to be relieved by the use of the Wisbaden waters
internally and externally employed. The baths, by exciting the activity
of the nervous and vascular systems, and by determining powerfully to the
surface, tend most materially to equalize the circulation and remove the
internal congestion, while by the internal use of the water the secretions
of the mucous membranes, of the alimentary canal, of the liver and kidneys,
are improved in quality, and often perceptibly increased in quantity;—at
the same time that the mesenteric glands and absorbent vessels are
stimulated to increased activity, and the digestion is consequently improved.
Even when, under these circumstances, the drinking of the water
is not followed by immediate sensible effects, either upon the bowels or
kidneys, it is frequently not the less efficient on that account, and unless
some inconvenience be experienced, it should be persisted in, as after a
certain time copious critical evacuations will often occur, and be followed
by immediate relief; whereas were similar effects produced by artificial
means, as the exhibition of drugs, the relief would only be temporary,
and the frequent repetition of the same or analogous measures, would be
necessary, and would tend but little to the permanent amelioration of the
patient. In several of these cases, especially where there exists hardness
or tension in the region of the liver, spleen, or in other parts of the abdomen,
the douche will be of material assistance in the treatment.”</p>

<p>“In many cases of paralysis, baths of mineral waters offer the most
efficient, and often the only means of arousing the nervous energy of the
system, and of the paralysed parts; and few have a more beneficial influence
in this way than those of Wisbaden; but here again it cannot always
be determined beforehand, that baths of this kind will be more effectual
than those of other springs containing but a small proportion of solid and
gaseous substance, as the latter occasionally succeed after the failure of
the former. In the obscurity which still envelops the mode of action of
mineral baths, this cannot be satisfactorily accounted for, except upon the
principle of idiosyncrasy, or by the supposition that the disturbing action
of a thoroughly impregnated spring is less adapted to certain of these
cases, than the more tranquilizing and sedative influence of a simple thermal,
or slightly alkaline, warm spring. In most instances, however, where
there does not exist a high degree of nervous excitability, or tendency to
fulness in the cerebral vessels, the baths of Wisbaden may be used with
great prospect of advantage; especially when the complaint is of a rheumatic
origin, depending upon the impression of poisonous influences upon
the nervous system, as malaria, the abuse of mercury, or the employment
of this and some other metals by workmen; as also in those cases, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the disease appears to be of a purely local nature, not connected with
cerebral disease, but arising from deficient energy of the nerves of the part,
or of the spinal marrow, consequent upon exposure to cold and wet, or
other analogous causes. Even in paralysis affecting a limb or one side
of the body, remaining after an apoplectic seizure, baths of this and other
mineral waters may often be advantageously employed, provided there be
no symptoms of cerebral congestion, or organic disease. Plethoric individuals,
and those whose digestive organs are disordered, will frequently
require some preparatory treatment, previous to using the baths, in paralytic,
as well as in other diseases. These, then, are the principal diseases
which the Wisbaden waters are more especially calculated to relieve, and
in which their use in the form of baths and douches is the most essential
part of the treatment. There are besides various other complaints to
which the external or internal use of the water, or both combined, is extremely
suitable, in common with several other mineral springs; but of
which the peculiar circumstances of each case require to be investigated,
in order to enable the practitioner to decide upon the springs likely to be
most effectual. Of these, many scrofulous affections will be cured or
greatly ameliorated by the internal and external application of these waters;
particularly enlarged lymphatic glands of various parts, and of the mesentery,
occurring in children or young persons of a torpid habit, with tumid
upper lip and abdomen, a vitiated state of the intestinal secretions, and a
harsh dry condition of the skin. Here the exciting and resolvent powers
of the waters are exceedingly effectual, by improving and augmenting the
secretions of the alimentary canal, and of the skin; and, by stimulating the
absorbent and vascular systems, mostly cause the speedy diminution of
glandular or bony swellings.</p>

<p>“Another case, in which the Wisbaden springs are often eminently
serviceable, is, where there is a general disordered state of the health,
without the existence of any actual disease, or material derangement of
any particular functions, except perhaps impaired digestive powers—as is
very frequently seen in Londoners, and inhabitants of other large cities,
closely engaged in trading, mercantile or professional occupations; as also
in those who have been resident in a tropical or unhealthy climate: such
a state, though relieved and palliated for a time by medicines, not unfrequently
terminates in serious functional or structural disease, if allowed
to continue for a long period—and nothing would tend more effectually
to its removal than temporary absence from the cares of avocation, change
of air and mode of life, and the employment of a mineral spring like
Wisbaden, followed by that of a chalybeate water, in those cases where it
is not counterindicated.</p>

<p>“The same may be said of several cases of hypochondriasis, with
disordered digestive powers, to which Wisbaden is applicable, both on
account of its waters, tending to rectify the deranged state of the digestive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
organs, and also from the beneficial influence which would be exerted in
most instances on the patient’s <i>morale</i>, by the movement of the place, its
cheerful appearance, the beauty of its environs, and the neighbourhood of
so many objects of interest. To some patients of this class, tepid bathing
with the internal use of a cold gaseous spring is most applicable. To
others again, certain other mineral springs are best adapted.</p>

<p>“The suppression or painful performance of periodical functions peculiar
to females, is frequently benefitted by the Wisbaden baths; especially,
if the cause be cold, checked perspiration, or a congested state of the abdominal
or pelvic viscera. Some syphilitic affections, especially where
much mercury has been employed, and certain chronic cutaneous diseases,
as psoriasis, impetigo, &amp;c. where the skin is generally in a dry state; as
also eruptions of the face depending upon derangement of the alimentary
canal or liver, will often be removed, by baths of a warm saline water, like
Wisbaden; and likewise by sulphurous or alkaline springs, either alone, or
combined with the internal use of the same, or some other mineral water.
In certain bronchial and laryngeal affections, with cough, and scanty or
deficient expectoration, the Wisbaden baths, combined with the internal
use of the water, and the inhalation of its vapour, may be expected to be
of material advantage.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, these springs, like most others, will generally be
prejudicial in organic disease of the lungs, heart, or large vessels, in disorganisation
of the abdominal or pelvic viscera, with fever, profuse
hemorrhagy or discharges <i>per vaginam</i>, either depending upon relaxation
or upon the presence of hypertrophy, polypus, or other structural
disease.”<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<h3 id="SCHLANGENBAD">SCHLANGENBAD.</h3>

<p>The extensive cook-shop and laboratory under Wisbaden have communicated
no small portion of caloric to the air, as well as to the waters of
that place. We no sooner begin to ascend the slopes or ridges of the
Taunus than we experience a remarkable transition from languor and oppression
to vigor and elasticity—not confined to the <i>physique</i>, but extending
also to the <i>morale</i>. Of the two roads from Wisbaden to Schlangenbad,
we preferred the mountainous, or inland route, to that along the
Rhine, for the sake of a bracing air and a boundless prospect. We trotted
merrily along the hills and vales of the Taunus, over a Macadamized road,
till, in two hours, we found ourselves, all at once, in a romantic dell or
valley, bounded on both sides, by densely wooded mountains rising nearly
perpendicular, from the narrow space between. In this small compass rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
three or four huge buildings, white as snow, and each having more windows
than there are days in the year. I set them down as manufactories
of cotton or cutlery, but the absence of all clanking of machinery or hissing
of steam, soon undeceived me. On driving into a little square between
the two principal Hoffs, all was silent as Pompeii—and not a human being
was seen in any direction. There was no competition here between the
two chief hotels—both belonging to one master—and he the sovereign of
the country. As it was about 12 o’clock, all true Germans were in their
holes and corners, meditating on, and preparing for the grand <i>business</i> of
the day—the onslaught of the <i>couteau</i> and <i>fourçhette</i> at the <i>mittag</i> table-d’hôte.
To the Serpent’s Bath, the intervening hour was dedicated. The
cosmetic and renovating qualities of the Schlangenbad are nearly as far-famed
now as the cauldron of Medea was, in days of yore. The Old Man
of the Brunnens dipped his pencil in prime copal <i>varnish</i>, when he <i>embellished</i>
the baths of this sequestered valley. The description is a real
bijou of its kind,—a diamond of the first <i>water</i>—equally profitable to the
pen of the painter and the purse of the royal proprietor!</p>

<p>“The baths at Schlangenbad are the most harmless and delicious luxuries
of the sort I have ever enjoyed; and I really quite looked forward to
the morning for the pleasure with which I paid my addresses to this delightful
element. The effect it produces on the skin is very singular; it
is about as warm as milk, but infinitely softer: and after dipping the hand
into it, if the thumb be rubbed against the fingers, it is said by many to
resemble satin. Nevertheless, whatever may be its sensation, when the
reader reflects that people not only come to these baths from Russia, but
that the water in stone bottles, merely as a cosmetic, is sent to St. Petersburg
and other distant parts of Europe, he will admit that it must be soft
indeed to have gained for itself such an extraordinary degree of celebrity:
for there is no town at Schlangenbad, not even a village—nothing therefore
but the real or fancied charm of the water could attract people into
a little sequestered valley, which in every sense of the word is out of sight
of the civilised world; and yet I must say, that I never remember to have
existed in a place which possessed such fascinating beauties; besides which,
(to say nothing of breathing pure dry air,) it is no small pleasure to live
in a skin, which puts all people in good humour—at least with themselves.
But besides the cosmetic charms of this water, it is declared to possess
virtues of more substantial value: it is said to tranquillize the nerves, to
soothe all inflammation; and from this latter property, the cures of consumption
which are reported to have been effected, among human beings
and cattle, may have proceeded. Yet whatever <i>good</i> effect the water may
have upon this insidious disorder, its first operation most certainly must be
to neutralize the <i>bad</i> effect of the climate, which to consumptive patients
must decidedly be a very severe trial, for delightful as it is to people in
robust health, yet the keenness of the mountain air, together with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
sudden alternations of temperature to which the valley of Schlangenbad
is exposed, must, I think, be anything but a remedy for weak lungs.</p>

<p>“The effect produced upon the skin, by lying about twenty minutes in
the bath, I one day happened to overhear a short, fat Frenchman describe
to his friend in the following words—‘<i>Monsieur, dans ces bains on devient
absolument amoureux de soi-même!</i>’ I cannot exactly corroborate this
Gallic statement, yet I must admit that limbs, even old ones, gradually do
appear as if they were converted into white marble. The skin assumes a
sort of glittering, phosphoric brightness, resembling very much white objects,
which, having been thrown overboard, in calm weather within the
tropics, many of my readers have probably watched sinking in the ocean,
which seems to blanch and illuminate them as they descend. The effect
is very extraordinary, and I know not how to account for it, unless it be
produced by some prismatic refraction, caused by the peculiar particles with
which the fluid is impregnated.</p>

<p>“The Schlangenbad water contains the muriates and carbonates of lime,
soda, and magnesia, with a slight excess of carbonic acid which holds the
carbonates in solution. The celebrated embellishment which it produces
on the skin is, in my opinion, a sort of corrosion, which removes tan, or
any other artificial covering that the surface may have attained from exposure
and ill-treatment by the sun and wind. In short, the body is
cleaned by it, just as a kitchen-maid scours her copper saucepan; and the
effect being evident, ladies modestly approach it from the most distant parts
of Europe. I am by no means certain, however, that they receive any
permanent benefit; indeed, on the contrary, I should think that their
skins would eventually become, if anything, coarser, from the removal of a
slight veil or covering, intended by nature as a protection to the cuticle.</p>

<p>“But whether this water be permanently beneficial to ladies or not, the
softness it gives to the whole body is quite delightful: and with two elements,
air and water, in perfection, I found that I grew every hour more
and more attached to the place.”</p>

<p>This glowing description of the Old Man has worked a greater miracle
than that of changing water into wine. It has actually transmuted the
spring of Schlangenbad into liquid gold—<i>aurum potabile!</i> If the author
be accused of “exaggeration”—(now a dangerous term)—he may quote
the sentiments of the <span class="smcap">Esculapius</span>—the Apollo of the place.</p>

<p>“Never did bath produce such delightful sensations as the Serpent’s
Bath at Schlangenbad. These salubrious waters exert on the body an
agreeable and gentle pressure—voluptuously expand the limbs—and tranquillize
the nerves and the blood. You rise from the waters of Schlangenbad
<i>like a Phœnix from its ashes</i>. Youth becomes more beautiful—more
brilliant—and old age is imbued with new vigour.”<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Well done Dr. Fenner! You have beaten the “Old Man of the
Brunnens” fairly out of the field! Why the very waters themselves
must have blushed when they saw the account of these their miraculous
qualities—and the serpents must have waltzed merrily round the pine
trees that overhang the source of the magic Brunnen.</p>

<p>And yet the whole is little more than an ingenious romance, closely allied
to the legends of the neighbouring Rhine—as the story of the Drachenfels,
for example. It is unnecessary to comment on the <span class="smcap">Phœnix</span> of Dr. Fenner.
That fabulous bird speaks for itself; but Sir F. Head’s account requires
some remark. In the first place, the appearance of the limbs and body of
the bather, is precisely the same as in other clear and tepid waters, as
those of Wisbaden, Baden-Baden, Wildbad, &amp;c.—or, indeed, in plain
water. The “glittering phosphoric brightness,” and the blanching and
illumination of sinking bodies in tropical seas, are all the offspring of a
fanciful or poetical imagination. Then again, the soapy, satiny, and
unctuous feel communicated by the Schlangenbad waters, is not peculiar
to them. The first time I ever bathed in the Ems waters, many years
ago, I remarked this, and can never forget the sense of <i>bien-être</i> which I
then experienced. And no wonder, for the waters of Ems are infinitely
more alkaline—especially in the baths—than those of Schlangenbad.
The effects, however, of these last on the skin, appeared to me more
marked and pleasant than those of Wildbad, Wisbaden, or Baden-Baden.
The tranquillity and sedative qualities of the Serpent’s Bath are somewhat
exaggerated by the “<span class="smcap">Old Man</span>,” and outrageously so by Dr. Fenner;
but nevertheless they possess these influences to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>And here I must say that my friend Dr. Granville appears to have
viewed poor Schlangenbad with a jaundiced eye.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The waters of the
Kochbrunnen may have stirred up the bile—for assuredly the waters of
Schlangenbad are clearer, and the mountains are higher, and the trees are
larger than he has represented them. The very description of Captain
Head proves the transparency of the waters—and the following passage
from Mr. Lee, which I can corroborate, will remove the stigma from the
baths themselves.</p>

<p>“The bathing-cabinets, notwithstanding the depreciating terms in
which Dr. Granville has spoken of them, are exceedingly convenient,
more so, indeed, than at most other baths, and infinitely superior to the
closets for undressing adjoining the piscinæ at Wildbad. They are for
the most part lofty and well ventilated, and are divided into a dressing-room
and a large and spacious marble <i>baignoire</i> capable of containing five
or six persons; though it is only intended for a single person; bathing
in common not being the practice at Schlangenbad. The bather consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
is not obliged to lie down in water about two feet deep, but has
ample space to play or move about, the water being admitted in large
quantity, so as to rise nearly breast-high; the temperature can also be
increased by the bather, at pleasure, by admitting more warm water,
though some persons, in the height of summer, prefer bathing in the
water at its natural temperature,—about 22° Reaumur. A bath of this
water, like others of the same class, imparts softness to the skin, with a
pleasurable sensation while it lasts, and a feeling of <i>bien-être</i> for the
remainder of the day.”<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The waters of Schlangenbad contain only about six grains of solid
substances in the pint—half of which is carbonate of soda—and very
little carbonic acid gas. Small as these ingredients are, they are larger
than those in the waters of Wildbad, or Pfeffers. They are, as Captain
Head observes, safe waters, both for bathing and drinking. The temperature
being about 86°—something higher than Buxton, they may be
used by many people without any artificial increase. But, generally
speaking, it will be prudent to raise them ten or twelve degrees for gouty
and rheumatic patients. Every body knows—or has been told—that the
medicinal virtues of Schlangenbad waters were discovered by a hide-bound
heifer—and proved by a young lady under a similar state of skin. Whether
this story be true or fabulous, I cannot tell; but I apprehend that
its cosmetic and satinizing properties are those which draw most of its
foreign customers from the shores of the Baltic, and the banks of the
Thames. Captain Head justly suspects the durability of the satin skin—and
there is little doubt that if half a pound of soda or potash were added
to a common warm bath in England, the same softness of surface would
be the result.</p>

<p>I do not much wonder that the “Old Man” should have become enamoured
of Schlangenbad, considering the disposition which he evinced for
solitude, contemplation, and reflection. The locality is well adapted for all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
these. Society is so concentrated in this little valetudinarium, and so
quiet withal, that human nature may be studied with a kind of “microscopic
eye,” and all its modifications, peculiarities, and eccentricities noted
without distraction or bustle. On the mountain’s romantic brow, under
the shade of the sombre pine, and in the stillness and serenity of the
forest, the mind has ample time to meditate on, and inwardly digest the
observations made in the little miniature world below.</p>

<p>As one o’clock approached, the solitude of Schlangenbad began to exhibit
some symptoms of change. From various points of the compass
isolated individuals, bearing the marks of illness, were seen carefully picking
out the softest—or, at all events, the <i>smoothest</i> stones of the pavé,
over which to wend their way, towards what an Irishman would call
“three centres” of attraction. Soon afterwards, we heard three or four
bells simultaneously sounding, when immediately the solitary videttes
were succeeded by whole columns marching to their appointed rendezvous.
Never did veteran Roman phalanx advance with more steady pace—more
death-like silence—or more inflexible resolution, to the assault of
barbarian foe, than does a German corps—men, women, and children—to
the work of demolition at a mittag table-d’hôte.</p>

<p>Falling into the ranks of the largest column, we soon found ourselves
in the salle-a-manger of the New Bad Haus, where about one hundred sat
down to dinner. There was a fair proportion of English—full an eighth
of the whole. There is little difficulty in distinguishing the German from
the Britannic guests. The sallow complexion, black and broken teeth,
matted locks, extravagant mustachios—and transcendental salutations at
meeting and parting—are some of the most prominent features of distinction;
yet there are many others of a minor cast.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> An inferiority in
the cloth of the coat—a peculiarity in what a sailor would call “the cut of
the jib”—enormous rings on the fingers, and brooches in the breast, are
characteristic of our German neighbours. Independently of these, you may
smoke a German in any part of the room—or scent him at a quarter of a
mile’s distance in the open air, if the wind be favourable. For although
he ceases to smoke when he begins to eat, yet from one pocket the reeking
pipe is exhaling its odours—while from the other, a load of the
“cursed weed” itself is diffusing its aroma in all directions. But I find
that I have been mistaken in giving a truce to smoking during the act of
eating. The fair author of “Souvenirs” has corrected me. “Yonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
is an old gentleman actually eating and smoking at the same time—the
long pipe being pushed into one corner of his mouth, so as to leave an
entrance in front for the spoon or fork.” On reading this passage, I
could not help feeling certain anatomical and physiological difficulties in
the way of this triple function of mastication, smoking, and swallowing,
being all simultaneous. I believe I can explain the phenomenon, however,
without questioning the fact of the fair writer. Every person must
have seen a horse eat oats and hay, with the bit of the bridle in his
mouth. It was so with the old gentleman. All Germans have numerous
vacancies among their grinders, and the one in question was able to keep
his pipe ready lit for service between the courses, in one corner of his
mouth. But it is certain that the triple or even double function of smoking
and eating simultaneously, is next to impossible.</p>

<p>These external peculiarities of the German are probably not more striking
to John Bull, than are the singularities of the latter to the German.
As to internal qualities—moral and intellectual—my conviction is, that the
German has far more head and heart than nine-tenths of his continental
and insular neighbours.</p>

<p>In fine, the more I have seen of the Germans, the more I admire their
honesty, zeal, single-heartedness, quietude, order, hospitality, learning,
and humanity. These solid qualities leave the little personal peculiarities
which I have sketched above, as “dust in the balance.”</p>

<p>It is not quite so easy to discriminate between the German ladies and
those of our own country, as between the gentlemen of the two nations.
One reason is, that the German ladies do not smoke long pipes, and wear
long mustachios. I shall not libel the sex, as Pope has done, by making
the colour of the hair the characteristics of women:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“And best distinguished by black, brown, or fair.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There is one peculiarity in the manners of the German fair (besides a certain
“je ne sçais quoi,”) which is, their <span class="smcap">bowing</span> instead of <span class="smcap">curtseying</span>,
on meeting or parting from friends—and that quite as low as their
brothers, fathers, and husbands. This was the reason of my introducing
the term “<i>bussel</i>-rending” in the description of a German <span class="smcap">salaam</span>.</p>

<h4>TABLE-D’HÔTE.</h4>

<p>Not being deeply versed in the science of gastronomy and its nomenclature,
I shall introduce the following order and succession of dishes as
drawn by a fair countrywoman (Souvenirs of a Summer in Germany,)
whose fidelity of description cannot be doubted.</p>

<p>“First, as usual, was the soup—then the invariable boiled beef, with
its accompaniments of pickled cucumber, onions, or sour krout. After
the beef, is a course of cutlets, sliced raw ham, omelettes, and vegetables.
Then come partridges, chickens, sausages, ducks—all which are replaced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
by various kinds of fish—some so besauced and bedecked with garnishes,
that they are hardly recognizable as belonging to the finny tribe—and
pyramidical dishes of cray-fish. The puddings come next, with smoking
boats of fruit and wine-sauce. Is this the finale? Not at all. The
pudding is a kind of æra, whence fresh courses take their date. A more
formidable array of dishes next makes its appearance. Roast joints—req,
(a kind of deer,) geese, turkeys, hares, &amp;c. &amp;c. with innumerable
satellites of preserved pears, plums, cherries, salads, &amp;c. This substantial
course is followed by sweets—cherry tarts—enormous cakes, all spices
and vanille with a snowy summit of powdered sugar—custards, creams,
&amp;c. The dessert and bon-bons close the proceedings.”</p>

<p>Now, it is to be observed, that this was the bill of fare at Schwalbach
or Schlangenbad, where nine-tenths of the guests are notoriously invalids.
It would scarcely serve for a dejeuner a la fourçhette at the sumptuaries
of Baden or Wisbaden. The fair authoress admits that the German partakes
of every dish; but argues that he does not eat more in the aggregate
than the Englishman. This statement is so decidedly contrary to all
observation, that I can only account for it by supposing that the fair lady
noted more accurately the compliments to “la belle Anglaise,” proceeding
out of the mouths of her favourite Germans, than the provender which
proceeded in a contrary direction. Is it likely that the keeper of a
German hotel would dress more dishes than are generally consumed,
seeing that the price of the whole dinner is under two shillings? Not he
indeed. The fact is undeniable that the Germans—indeed all the continentals
who can afford it, eat not only a greater variety and complication
of “dishes tortured from their native taste,” but a greater quantity
in the aggregate. The question naturally arises—what is the consequence?
Compare the complexions of the Germans and English. No
one will attempt to deny that the contrast is most striking. The tints of
health predominate in the looks of the Islanders—pallor and sallowness
in those of the Continental. But the lady may reply—“nimium ne crede
colori”—complexion, like beauty, is only skin-deep. Be it so. We shall
look deeper. Let us follow the example of the horse-dealer, and examine
the teeth. If my fair countrywoman has preserved any “souvenirs” of
these important actors in the drama of human life, she will not be inclined
to maintain that a German is like an elephant—with a mouth full of ivory.
I never saw the hearty laugh of an honest German, without thinking of a
temple—whose portal consisted of broken columns of ebony. If 40 Germans,
at the age of 40, were compared with the same number of English, at the
same age—all taken indiscriminately from the streets of Vienna and
London—what would be the comparative number of sound teeth in the
heads of the two classes? I shall attempt a calculation presently; mean
time, it will be admitted on all hands, that the Germans are woefully
afflicted with unsound teeth. What is the reason? A pair of mill-stones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
will grind only a certain quantity of corn—or last only a certain number
of years. It is the same with the human mill-stones, or molares. They
will only grind a certain quantity of food, or do a certain amount of labour,
before they are worn out, like their namesakes in the mill. Now if the
Germans eat one-third more than the English—and I firmly believe they
do—then their teeth have one-third more of work, and ought to experience
a corresponding degree of wear and tear. This, however, will not
account for the premature decay of the teeth, but only for their wearing
out sooner than under other circumstances. We must seek deeper for
the causes. As the millstones are spoiled and rendered useless by allowing
improper things to be mixed with the grain, as pebbles, &amp;c. so the
teeth are injured by the quality as well as by the quantity of our food.
The oils, acids, tobacco, and other deleterious substances, for ever mixing
with continental meals, must greatly injure the organs of mastication as
well as of digestion.</p>

<p>The human frame is a congeries of organs, all in harmony, when in
health, and each assisting the others. But when we deviate from simplicity
and temperance, these same organs quarrel with each other, to
the detriment, and sometimes to the destruction of the whole constitution.
The stomach is one of those patient and willing organs that
will work wonders for years and years; but at length it will rebel—and
even retaliate. The teeth, which have long sent down immoderate quantities
of food, too often of the most abominable composition, for the
stomach to grind over again, become visited with pains and penalties
by the offended organ, under the vain hope that less work will be done
in the upper mill. The warning is unheeded; and then the stomach begins
the process of demolition in good earnest. It is in this state of,
what the geologists would call “transition,” that we see the teeth of the
Germans—and, it must be confessed, of the English sometimes also—in
a state disagreeable to the eye, offensive to the nose, and injurious to the
health. The stomach, which has inflicted this punishment on the mouth,
so far from being benefitted thereby, is still farther injured by the failure
of mastication; and then the various organs and functions of the body
become involved in the consequences of long-continued deviations from
the paths of Nature, simplicity, and temperance!</p>

<p>If this penalty be still considered as imaginary, I shall adduce more
cogent arguments. The bills of mortality contain very stubborn facts.
Let us take the two capitals of Germany and England—Vienna and
London. In the <i>former</i>, one twenty-fourth of the population goes to the
grave annually:—in the latter (London) one-fortieth part only. In the
language of the insurance-offices, “the value of life is more than one-third
greater in London than in Vienna.” Now this difference will surely
not be attributed to climate merely—since the continentals themselves
anathematize the climate of England, and the fogs of London, as most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
“horrid.” Here then we have some clue to the comparative number of
teeth in individuals of the same age, at home and abroad. We shall probably
find the proportion of 24 to 40 (the ratio of mortality) as exhibiting
a fair estimate of the number of teeth in equal masses of the population
in Germany and England. Thus, for example, if the Englishman, at the
age of 50, have twenty teeth in his head, the German, at the same period
of life, will have only twelve, and so on.</p>

<p>But to return to the table-d’hôte. A glance round the “<span class="smcap">salle-a-manger</span>”
brought a strong conviction on my mind, that <span class="smcap">Fame</span> had either
exaggerated the virtues of the Serpent’s Bath, or had excited hopes that
would seldom be realized. A majority of the guests were females; and
not a few of these were of a certain—or rather of an <i>uncertain</i>, age. Of
the males, the greater number were evidently dandies in decay. I never
remember to have seen, in the same compass, a greater variety of feature
and complexion—indicating a re-union, in this sequestered spot, of individuals
from various and remote regions. But however diversified in external
physiognomy, there was one point in which there was a wonderful
coincidence and similarity—that point was—<i>not</i> the point of <span class="smcap">beauty</span>. It
is with mortification, I confess, that the English portion of the guests did
not form a prominent exception to the general rule. To say the truth,
the whole company exhibited sorry samples of the great European and
Transatlantic family;—and if appetite was any index, the majority had met
here, partly for health, but principally for—<span class="smcap">re</span>-<i>creation</i>. How far the
transmutation from age to youth—from decrepitude to vigour—from the
wrinkled skin to the polished surface, was effected by plunges in the
Serpent’s Bath, I had not time to ascertain. I candidly acknowledge that
I never saw a <i>real</i> phœnix—but if <i>these</i> were specimens of Dr. Fenner’s
phœnixes, “rising from their ashes,” then I must say that they very much
resembled a batch of old cocks and hens roosting at Schlangenbad during
the molting season.</p>

<p>The first impression which a stranger receives, while prying through
Schlangenbad, is that the waters have an uglifying rather than a beautifying
effect on the human frame. This is erroneous. We do not go through
the wards of an hospital to search for samples of rude health—neither
ought we to go to Schlangenbad for specimens of smooth skin and delicate
complexion.</p>

<p>We rambled through winding and umbrageous paths up the mountain
behind the Old Bad-haus, to its summit—and I think there are few places
in the world better adapted to profound meditation, while, at the same
time, inspiring the most pure, bracing, and salubrious atmosphere. I
descended in a contemplative mood, when I stumbled into a long kind of
gallery or hall, which looked like an enclosed promenade. There the
accursed <span class="smcap">roulette</span>-table met my eye and excited my choler. What! In
this valley of Rasselas—in this asylum of health—in this peaceful retreat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
from the stormy passions of the city—to find the symbol of Hell, and the
instrument of the devil, was more than I could bear with patience! True,
it was deserted. Not a human being was seen in the place; but its presence
indicated too surely the work of destruction that would go on in
the evening. Julius Cæsar, I think, observed that the Germans, in his
time, were so passionately addicted to gambling, that, when they had lost
all their money and goods, they would stake their wives and children!
It therefore seems to be impossible to eradicate this dreadful propensity
from the German mind. Still the public exercise of it might be prevented.
The King of Saxony prohibits and <i>prevents</i> smoking in Dresden! If such
a miracle as this can be wrought in Germany, we need not despair, even
of gambling!</p>

the pen of genius can throw round the most common subjects. Schwalbach
is still as it was, in a deep narrow valley—and invisible till we are
within a few hundred yards of it. The houses, though more generally
painted, and greatly increased in number since the time of the “Old Man,”
are still as though they had been shaken in a bag and scattered through
the ravine, without the slightest regard to order or regularity. Sir Francis
could find no shops in his time—now he would find a bazaar! The town
is still somewhat in the form of a Y or a fork, at the end of one prong of
which is the <span class="smcap">Stahl-brunnen</span>—while the other prong, or rather prongs,
boasts of two hygeian fountains—the <span class="smcap">Wein-brunnen</span> and the <span class="smcap">Paulinen-brunnen</span>.
The <span class="smcap">Wein-brunnen</span> is the most powerful—the <span class="smcap">Stahl-brunnen</span>
is the most palatable—and the <span class="smcap">Pauline</span> is the most fashionable.
The climate of this place, according to the testimony of Dr. Fenner, supported

are all of the radical cast. They are qualified to break down and expel
the rotten and decayed parts of the constitution—but they can seldom
build up or repair the vacant spaces. The chalybeate spas, among which
<span class="smcap">Schwalbach</span> holds a distinguished rank, unite the principles of conservatism
and reform. They are calculated to preserve the original constitution,
and to <i>re</i>-form those portions that have been pulled down and extruded

<p>In none of the three springs is there more than three-fourths of a grain
of iron to the pint—and in the Pauline—the most fashionable one—there
is little more than half a grain; but it contains nearly 40 cubic inches of
carbonic acid gas to the pint, which, with six grains of carbonate of
sodium, two grains of carbonate of lime, and nearly three grains of magnesia,
makes it the most ætherial and aperient of the three sisters. The
water of the Wein-brunnen is limpid, pleasant to the taste, and sparkling
like champaigne. It is very easy of digestion, even when taken in considerable
quantity. Almost immediately after being swallowed, it produces
an agreeable warmth in the stomach, and thence diffuses a sensation
of comfort, nearly amounting to pleasure, through the whole frame. It
acts gently on the bowels in most cases. It is easily preserved in bottles
for any length of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The Stahl-brunnen is the greatest favourite with the ladies. It contains
about three-fourths of a grain of iron, and little more than three
grains of other substances in the pint. It is sharper and rougher to the
taste, and has more of the inky gout than either of the other springs. It
is also much more refreshing and exhilarating. The carbonic acid is very
abundant. The waters more nearly resemble Champaigne than the other
sources, and quickly diffuse a powerful energy over the whole frame.
Formerly these waters caused an eruption on the skin; but they do not
so at present.</p>

<p>The Pauline was only discovered in 1828, at a depth of fourteen feet.
The quantity it discharges is prodigious. The taste is extremely agreeable
and refreshing. It is one of the mildest and purest chalybeates that
is known. It is very easy of digestion, and operates very gently on the
bowels. By quickly amalgamating itself with the blood, it is rapidly diffused
through every organ and tissue of the body, producing favourable
changes there, and proving a general restorative. The vigor which it inspires
is remarkable from day to day—and the change of complexion from
pale to rosy, is equally surprising.</p>

<p>The waters of Schwalbach, generally belong to the class of æthereal or
volatile chalybeates—very agreeable to the palate, and producing a slight
and temporary feeling of intoxication. Their chief ingredients are steel
and carbonic acid, in such a state of combination as gives the iron a great
efficacy in consequence of its minute solution in the waters.</p>

<p>“At the same time (says Dr. Fenner,) that this spring causes agreeable
sensations in the palate and stomach, it excites the muscular fibres
and the nerves of the whole alimentary canal, into a state of activity—invigorates
the circulation—corrects the secretions—increases them when
defective—and gives new vigor to the whole process of digestion and
nutrition. In doing this it enlivens the spirits, and imparts tone to the
intellectual functions.”</p>

<p>The indications for using the Schwalbach chalybeates, according to the
same authority, are the following:—</p>

<p>1. In atony or debility of the stomach and bowels, whether from
natural constitution, or from excesses previously committed—whether
isolated from other complaints, or connected with affections of other
organs, as the liver, spleen, &amp;c. This atony eventuating in difficult,
painful, or imperfect digestion, with all its consequences, is remedied by
the waters. It is in these kinds of complaints that the Stahl-brunnen is
chiefly employed—“the Wein-brunnen being too strong, and the Pauline
too volatile.” Strict regimen, in such cases, is indispensible.</p>

<p>2. When the blood is in a watery or deteriorated condition—when it is
deficient in red globules—and consequently not fitted to support the energies
of the muscles, the tone of the nerves, or the functions of the great
organs of assimilation, secretion, &amp;c. It is in such cases that the chalybeates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
produce their most brilliant and unequivocally good effects. Females,
from the delicacy of their constitutions, the effects of civilization,
and certain disorders to which their sex subjects them, are the peculiar
votaries of these springs. Hence those affected with chlorosis—with
hæmorrhages—with menorrhagia—hysteria—obstructions, &amp;c. are seen
flocking to Schwalbach, there to regain strength, colour, and health.</p>

<p>“Quels que les noms des maladies qui se developpent, ici le malade
peut esperer, avec raison, d’etre gueri. Quelques semaines suffisent souvent
pour regenerer ses humeurs d’une maniere sensible.”</p>

<p>Although this is the assurance of a <span class="smcap">Spa Doctor</span>, yet the nature of
these waters, and the reputation they have obtained, produce a considerable
degree of confidence in the assertion of Dr. Fenner.</p>

<p>3. In great weakness of the nerves, and where their influence is not
sufficient to impart energy to the various functions, particularly of chylification
and sanguification, the chalybeates of Schwalbach are said to
have proved eminently serviceable. Dr. Fenner asserts their efficacy in
hypochondriasis, hysteria, melancholia, and in partial and complete paralysis.
In sterility they have also acquired considerable reputation.</p>

<h4>COUNTER-INDICATIONS.</h4>

<p>The waters of Schwalbach have limits to their medicinal agency, and
are even injurious in many states of disease.</p>

<p>1. In plethoric states of the constitution, accompanied by irritable condition
of the heart and great vessels—in sanguineous temperaments—and
in all cases where there is a tendency to local inflammation or general
fever—or even to congestion in any of the organs or tissues of the
body. “High attacks of acute inflammation, of hæmorrhage, and of
apoplexy, have followed the imprudent employment of these chalybeates.”—<i>Fenner.</i></p>

<p>2. In those cases of indigestion, connected with, or dependent on,
organic disease of stomach, liver, spleen, kidneys, or mesenteric glands,
these waters would be improper and hurtful.</p>

<p>3. But the chalybeates of Schwalbach are not to be recommended in
cases where the vital powers are <i>greatly</i> prostrated—the blood and humours
extremely vitiated—or the nervous system too much shattered.
“Those who venture on these waters, under such circumstances, and
where the constitution is at so low an ebb,—‘trouvent, loin des siens et
de leur patrie, une mort certaine et premature.’”—<i>Fenner.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The waters are taken fasting. The best season is the spring and summer.
From one to three glasses are prescribed, with a quarter of an
hour’s exercise between each glass. After this a light breakfast, where
the bath is not used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE BATHS.</h4>

<p>These are prescribed in the morning, after taking a glass or two of the
waters. They are generally given at a low temperature, such as 90° of
Fahrenheit, unless ordered otherwise. They therefore are several degrees
lower than the heat of the bather’s blood, and about the same heat as the
<i>external</i> surface of the body. They feel neither warm nor cold; but it is
asserted by Sir F. Head, who used them for some time, that they impart
a feeling of invigoration soon after immersion—and “he could almost
have fancied himself lying with a set of hides in a tan-pit.” The same
author remarks that they are very apt to produce—“headaches, sleepiness,
and other slightly apoplectic symptoms.” He thinks these effects
must result from not immersing the head as well as the body. In this
he is mistaken. The best way to avoid such consequences is to keep
the head cool—and the atmosphere of the bath is and must be many degrees
below that of the water. The bare head will therefore be cooler
out of the bath than in it. But the fact is, that the symptoms above-mentioned
are not seldom apt to occur in all tepid and warm baths, from
the action of the waters on the nervous and vascular systems of the surface,
producing an excitement and determination to the brain. They
should be taken as warnings, and not be trifled with.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, the waters of Schwalbach, from what I could learn
on the spot, and from those who have prescribed them, and used them,
are very useful and mild chalybeates, which may be considered as a kind
of “<span class="smcap">finish</span>,” after the powerful alterative waters of Wisbaden, and the
strong alkaline waters of Ems;—always remembering that <span class="smcap">Schlangenbad</span>
is to give a <i>polish</i> to the surface at the end of the process.</p>

<h4>GERMAN SOCIETY AND MANNERS.</h4>

<p>There are few places where a stranger can have a better coup-d’œil of
German habits and manners, than at the <span class="smcap">spas</span>; where all ranks and classes,
from the prince to the peasant, are jumbled together, without ever jostling
each other. They drink together, bathe together, walk together, talk
together, smoke together, joke together, dine together, muse together,
sup together—and, then go to bed, all with the greatest decorum, quietude,
civility—and I may add, ceremony.</p>

<p>“The company,” says Sir F. Head, “which comes to the brunnens for
health, and which daily assembles at dinner, is of a most heterogeneous
description, being composed of princes, dukes, barons, counts, &amp;c. down
to the petty shop-keeper, and even the Jew of Frankfort, Mainz, and other
neighbouring towns; in short, all the most jarring elements of society,
at the same moment, enter the same room, to partake together, the same
one shilling and eight-penny dinner—still, all those invaluable forms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
society which connect the guests of any private individual were most
strictly observed; and, from the natural good sense and breeding in the
country, this happy combination was apparently effected without any
effort. No one seemed to be under any restraint, yet there was no freezing
formality at one end of the table, nor rude boisterous mirth at the other.
With as honest good appetites as could belong to any set of people under
the sun, I particularly remarked that there was no scrambling for favourite
dishes;—to be sure, here and there, an eye was seen twinkling a little
brighter than usual, as it watched the progress of any approaching dish
which appeared to be unusually sour or greasy, but there was no greediness,
no impatience, and nothing which seemed for a single moment to
interrupt the general harmony of the scene; and, though I scarcely heard
a syllable of the buzz of conversation which surrounded me; although
every moment I felt less and less disposed to attempt to eat what for some
time had gradually been coagulating in my plate; yet, leaning back in my
chair, I certainly did derive very great pleasure, and I hope a very rational
enjoyment, in looking upon so pleasing a picture of civilized life.”</p>

<p>It must be candidly confessed that this scene, which is every where the
same, exhibits a striking contrast to spa-society in England, where each
class forms a clique that repels its neighbour, as one electrified ball repels
another. It is therefore highly desirable that the <i>cause</i> of this happy concordance
throughout the whole chain of society on the Continent, should
be ascertained, in order, if possible, to introduce it into our own country.
Sir F. Head seems to attribute it to a high degree of <i>civilization or refinement</i>.
“I fear it cannot be denied that we islanders are very far from
being as highly polished as our continental neighbours.” If civilization
consist in <i>civility</i>, I admit the truth of this assertion. But a Gentoo is
even more <i>civil</i> than a German—and a Chinese is more ceremonious than
either—yet we do not place the Hindoo or the Hong at the very top of
the tree of civilization.</p>

<p>But I apprehend that this harmonious amalgamation of all ranks and
classes in Germany is not to be traced to one, but to several causes. I
would attempt to account for the phenomenon by one, or more, or all of
the following circumstances.</p>

<p>1. Natural disposition.—2. Education, inducing habit.—3. Comparative
paucity of trade, commerce, and manufactures.—4. Government.</p>

<p>1. We see peculiarities in the natural dispositions of nations, as well
as of men. Some evince a disposition to music, another to arms, a third
to navigation, a fourth to agriculture, a fifth to commerce, &amp;c. The Germans
may have a natural disposition to order, quietude, and politeness.
Of this I am by no means sure.</p>

<p>2. What is man, individually or collectively, but the creature of those
circumstances in which he is placed?—of the elements around him—of
the education impressed on him—of the religion within his breast—of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
examples before his eyes? In all the lauded and laudable traits of character
delineated by Sir. F. Head, the German has been trained from his
infancy—and from these he has neither inducement nor inclination to
deviate.</p>

<p>3. The third circumstance I consider to be very operative. The struggles,
the collisions, the jealousies—the host of evil and of exciting
passions, which agitate a commercial, trading, maritime, and manufacturing
country like England, have, comparatively, no field in Germany;
where life is far more allied to agricultural and pastoral, than to commercial
and manufacturing pursuits. There is as much difference between
the Germans and the English, generally, as between the peasantry of
Lincolnshire and the mechanics of Birmingham—between the chaw-bacons
of Hampshire, and the black and white devils of Merthyr-Tidvill and
Sheffield.</p>

<p>4. <i>Government.</i>—I attribute no small share to this class of influential
causes in modifying the manners of a nation. In absolute monarchies,
where the will of the sovereign is the law of the people, the <i>latter</i> are not
likely to be so frisky, boisterous, and turbulent, as under a limited and
constitutional government, inclining to democracy, where the vox populi
is not seldom the vox Dei—and where—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent8">——Imprisoned factions roar,</div>
<div class="verse">And rampant Treason stalks from shore to shore.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On another occasion I shall allude to the minuteness with which the
German governments regulate the most trifling concerns of life, when
mentioning that a passenger in a public diligence is forbidden to move from
the seat allotted to him, to the next vacant one at his side, without permission
from the post-master of the first town at which the conveyance
stops! In such countries would the Age, the Satirist, or even the <span class="smcap">Times</span>
be long allowed to take liberties with crowned heads, courts, or ministers?
No verily! Their tongues would soon be as smooth, and civil and ceremonious,
as those of the crowds of spa-drinkers around the Wein-Brunnen
of Schwalbach!<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Whether the state of things on the South side of the Channel be better
or worse than that on the North, I presume not to say. Davus sum, non<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Œdipus. But I think I have proved that, while these differences exist, the
manners and habits of Germany are not likely to blend or amalgamate
with those of England. Nothing, I think, would produce this fusion of
the two people, except some strange geographical revolution that might
convert the British Isles into a small appendix to the Continent; without
“ships, colonies, or commerce”—without iron mines or coal mines—without
cotton or cutlery—without fisheries or factories—without steam-engines
or printing-presses—but above all, without that great national or normal
school of agitation—the <span class="smcap">Parliament</span>—where deputies learn to “speak
daggers,” and chartists are encouraged to make pikes—where orations are
directed not to the ears of the <span class="smcap">Commons</span>, but to the eyes of the <span class="smcap">Constituents</span>—where
the campaign is opened with a speech recommending concord;
carried on with speeches full of discord; and concluded with a
speech of gracious accord—finally, where multiplicity of <i>motion</i> in the
beginning is synonymous with paucity of <i>action</i> in the end. When all
these incentives to turbulence shall have vanished, and also when English
stomachs shall prefer sour krout and rancid oil to roast beef and brown
stout, then, and not till then, may Sir Francis hope to see his favourite
German <i>polish</i> and Gallic <i>varnish</i> lacquering over the rough manners of
his native Isle.</p>

<h3 id="HEIDELBERG">HEIDELBERG.</h3>

<p>Many a time have I dragged my weary limbs up the series of steep
terraces that lead to the old red Castle of Heidelberg. Not being able to
feign ecstasies which I do not feel, I fear I shall give great offence to those
sentimental tourists who discover in this town, castle, and surmounting
hills, romantic views and picturesque beauties of the first order. Upon this,
as upon all other occasions, I appeal to the unbiassed feelings of the traveller
himself. The mouldering ruins of the Red Castle have something about
them too modern for antiquity, and too antiquated for the modern. I am
unable to give any <i>architectural</i> explanation of this impression—unless it
be the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“I do not like thee Mr. Bell,</div>
<div class="verse">The reason why, I cannot tell!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The view from the Castle, and from the Botanical Garden above it, over
the alluvial plain that stretches to the Rhine, and embracing the country
to the West of that river, is interesting, but neither striking nor romantic.
The tiny <span class="smcap">Neckar</span>, that meanders along its rocky bed, in the travelling
season, excites our apprehensions lest it should fare the fate of the Arethusa,
and disappear altogether. When heavy rains descend among the
mountains of the Black Forest however, it makes up for its torpidity in the
dry weather, and thunders past Heidelberg in great foam and fury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>In rambling through the streets of Heidelberg, whose University is one
of the crack seminaries in Germany, we cannot help recognizing the students,
although deprived of their red caps and long hair, by order of Government.
They have a semi-academic, semi-barbarous,—or, perhaps,
more properly speaking, a semi-ruminating, semi-fumigating appearance,
not very distantly allied to the revolutionary or bandittal.</p>

<p>The German students of this and other Universities having ineffectually
endeavoured to regenerate—<i>id est</i>—to revolutionize their country,
were put under the <i>ban</i> of Austria and Prussia, a procedure which very
completely secured them against doing any mischief—<i>to the State</i>. Thus
cramped in their generous and patriotic enterprize to involve society in
war, they formed societies for warring among themselves, called the <span class="smcap">verbondungs</span>,
or congresses, for regulating, arranging, and conducting duels!!
The following graphic description of one of these fights, was drawn up on
the scene of action, in November 1839, by an eye-witness.</p>

<p>“On Wednesday last, as I took my customary walk after dinner, a friend
came up to me, and told me that he perceived by various circumstances
that a ‘lorgehen’ was about to take place. He pointed out to me a man
sauntering lazily along the bridge, with a basket slung over his shoulder,
and who stopped at every minute to look down into the water, or watch a
barge dragged with difficulty against the stream by its single horse. An
old woman sat at the corner of a house, a short distance up the river, in
a position which commanded a view of the bridge and the road from the
town, and a man pushed a boat about objectless in the middle of the river.
These, to the initiated eye, gave certain evidence of what was going on;
these persons being all employed in watching, that an alarm may be given
in case of the police gaining information of the affair. We walked for
some distance up the right bank of the Neckar, till we arrived at the
opening of a mountain gorge, down which a small stream rushed impetuously,
and from which a girl was apparently filling her pails. We ascended
this pass for a short distance till we arrived at a dirty, dilapidated house,
which my companion pointed out as the scene of these disgraceful combats.
We ascended to the door of the beer-shop by a flight of broken
steps, and passed through a passage into a yard, where two men were
grinding, to the highest pitch of sharpness, a long, thin, basket-handled
rapier; the blade resembled, in shape and sharpness, two blades of a pen-knife
placed back to back. In a few minutes we mounted to the first
floor, and traversing a low room set out with tables and benches for refreshment,
passed into a lofty and spacious saloon, without furniture of
any sort, but a few forms placed against the walls, and a table with towels
and a basin of water, in one corner. In the opposite corner of the room,
at about four yards apart, were marked upon the floor two letters in chalk;
these, the initials of the verbondungs to which the combatants belonged,
marked the position of the fighters. A few students stood listlessly about,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
smoking or talking in whispers. A man entered, and threw down near
the scene of action a bundle of swords, a huge, thickly stuffed glove,
reaching to the shoulder, and a piece of matting resembling a mattress, to
be tied round the middle of the second, to guard against chance thrusts.
Thus some minutes passed, till at length one of the gladiators themselves
appeared. He was a short, but strongly and beautifully proportioned young
man, having a pleasing countenance, with a thin silky moustache, and long
glossy, black hair, reaching far below his cap, which was drawn closely
over his eyes, and bore the colours of his club. His body, from the chest
downwards, was enveloped in a thickly stuffed leather apron, impervious
to every blow, but slashed and stained in a hundred places from the effects
of former contests. The neck was covered also with a thick defence,
above which he could hardly lift his chin. Lastly, his right arm was bandaged,
and wrapped so carefully with paddings, that it was necessary to
have a person to support it until the moment of fighting. The body was
only covered by a ragged and dirt-soiled shirt. Thus equipped, with his
sword-arm resting on the neck of a companion, the little hero began to
walk up and down the room to promote circulation and to exercise the
limbs. In a few minutes his antagonist entered, habited in the same
manner, his cap decked with his peculiar colour, resting his arm likewise
on a friend. He was a tall and handsome youth, his face was pale as
death, but his step was firm as he paced the saloon for the same purpose as
the other. At this minute not a sound was heard but the tramping of the
two combatants and their seconds as they passed and repassed each other
without the slightest regard. Neither of them spoke a word, and the
seconds but seldom addressed to them in a whisper some sentence of advice
or caution. Presently a movement was observed towards the approaching
scene of action; the few and almost indifferent spectators drew
round, and a chair was placed within, beside which the judge stood to
mark the number of the rounds. The combatants were led to their respective
posts, their right arms extended, holding their rapiers in hand, and
resting still on the arm of a friend. The seconds planted themselves at
their left side, equipped in their defensive trappings, and holding above
their heads a blunted sword. ‘<i>Silentium!</i>’ exclaimed the judge. The
quiet which reigned before became instantly doubly quiet. One second
cried aloud, ‘<i>Verbindite Kling</i>’ (‘fasten blades’ literally), placing at the
same time, the point of his mock weapon a little in advance of his principal,
the other doing likewise. ‘<i>Los</i>’ instantly followed, and the glittering
swords of the two gladiators were crossed for battle. A moment they
looked at one another, then their blades flashed in the air, a blow was
struck and parried, and the seconds struck their arms up with a cry of
‘Halt!’ The heavy sword arm was again rested on the attendants, and a
moment’s pause ensued. ‘<i>Silentium!</i>’ repeated the judge, and another
round began. Whenever a blow was aimed, whether it took effect or not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the seconds interfered, and the round was ended. Thus they continued
through twenty-two onsets without pause, except to replace a broken blade,
or for a fresh cap on the head of the combatants. The latter of the two
was a wary swordsman, who had fought frequently before. He watched
cautiously the movement of his adversary, and, whenever his stroke failed,
made a quick and well-directed blow at his head. He, though it was his
first battle, guarded well: but at length the blade of his opponent passed
like lightning through his cap, and inflicted an awful wound on his head.
A large space was laid bare, and his whole person deluged in blood: his
long thick hair hung matted and discoloured over his shoulders. In a few
moments, however, he retaliated fully upon his antagonist, his face was
laid open from the ear to the nose, effectually marking him for life. In all, five
wounds were given, three of which the smaller of the two received, having,
besides that on the head, one under the right arm and one under the ear;
the other had also a gash under the ear. In about twenty minutes the
number of onsets was completed; the combatants retired, their padding
was taken off, and the worst part of the affair began—namely, the sewing
up of the wounds. Here they are in the habit (as if to punish as much as
possible the folly of these duels) of <i>sewing</i> up even comparatively trifling
wounds, so that the mark is seen certainly for years after its infliction.
The tall man in a short time was able to walk home; the other, however,
was compelled to have a carriage, so weak had he become from loss of
blood. This, I must tell you, was an unusually bloody combat, as in two
others, which I saw immediately after, not a single wound was given. The
average number of duels taking place daily is seven: the consequence is,
that every third man you meet in the street has a gash across his face.”</p>

<p>Bad as is British pugilism, it is exceeded in atrocity by this barbarous
system of German duelism. What says the government to it? Virtually
and literally this:—“you are naughty boys, and deserve to be punished
for thus hacking and carving each other; but, as paternal solicitude for
the happiness of our loving subjects is our ruling principle, we will—<i>pension
a surgeon to sew up your wounds</i>. There, now, be gone—but mind,
young gentlemen! no <i>political</i> discussion in your verbondungs! If you
are ever caught at <i>that</i>, perpetual incarceration will be your lot!” This is
literally the fact. The state not only winks at this Gothic war among the
students, but pays a state surgeon for attending the wounded!<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The parents of youths going to universities of all kinds, have some
reason for anxiety—if they knew all:—but the <span class="smcap">verbondungs</span> of Germany
are a disgrace to civilized Europe!</p>

<h3 id="BADEN-BADEN">BADEN-BADEN.</h3>

<p>Along almost the whole way from Wisbaden to Baden-Baden, we have
Belgium on our right, and Devonshire on our left. The road, which
generally skirts the bases of the undulating hills to the eastward, has
hardly a rise or fall, the alluvial and fertile plain stretching away to
the Rhine, till the mountains of Alsace arrest the attention on the western
bank of that river. The whole space between the hills and the river,
was, indisputably, a lake, at some remote period, drained by the breaking
down of some obstruction to the stream—probably in the vicinity of the
present Lurley-rocks.</p>

<p>Five or six miles from Rastadt and the Rhine, embosomed in a narrow
dell, and encircled by steep and wooded hills, lies the far-famed <span class="smcap">Baden-Baden</span>.
The comparative localities of Wisbaden and this place, might be
imagined by supposing the former to be a saucer, and the latter an egg-cup.
And yet the air of Baden, though in an egg-cup, is fresher if not
purer, than that of its celebrated rival of Nassau, where there are no
eminences of any altitude within some miles of the town. It is true that
the thermal springs of Wisbaden are a few degrees higher in temperature
than those of Baden, but this is quite insufficient to account for the difference
of atmosphere.</p>

<p>A very few visits to the wells in the morning, the hells in the evening,
and the hotels in the middle of the day, will convince any observant
traveller that three-fourths of the sojourners at Baden, go there to drink
wine rather than water—and to lose money, rather than regain health.</p>

<p>The thermal springs here are of great antiquity. They served to scour
the Roman legions stationed at Baden, in the days of Aurelian, as they
now do to scald the pigs and poultry of the butchers and poulterers of the
same place. The far-famed Ursprung issues from the ruins of an old
Roman structure on the side of a hill overlooking the town, at a temperature
of 154 degrees of Fahrenheit, and in quantities sufficient to
wash and drench the whole town, visitors and all. The water is translucid,
and tastes much less either of the chickens or salt, than its contemporary
of the Kochbrunnen at Wisbaden. It has, however, especially
in the baths, a very faint odour of bear’s grease, or green fat, which I
have noticed when speaking of the Kochbrunnen. The whole of the
solid contents in a pint of the water, are only about 24 grains, of which
common salt makes 16 grains, the other ingredients being chiefly lime, in
different combinations with sulphuric, muriatic, and carbonic acids. There
is just iron enough for the chemists to swear by—but not for the drinkers
to distinguish by taste.</p>

<p>Whatever may <i>have</i> been the reputation of the Baden waters, taken
internally, I apprehend that their fame is not very great in the present
day. On several successive mornings, between five and eight o’clock, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the Ursprung, I never could muster more than 130 bibbers—many of
whom appeared to have been attracted to the Paleotechnicon from curiosity
rather than in search of health. Except occasionally a fashionable
lady’s-maid, or governess, no English were seen at the spring. The
waters being led, however, into all the principal hotels, where there are
baignoires in abundance, the number of bathers outstrip very considerably
the number of bibbers. Although the waters of Baden are neither
so potent when drunk, nor so stimulant when bathed in, as those of Wisbaden
and many other places, yet they manage to do a fair proportion of
the annual mischief occasioned by hot mineral springs in general. Thermal
spas and quack doctors, indeed, have more good luck than usually
falls to the lot of men and things. They completely reverse the order of
events in the moral world. Their good actions are graven on <i>brass</i>—their
evil deeds are written in <i>water</i>. Unless some illustrious character receive
his quietus in a hot bath—as the Duke of Nassau did at Kissengen—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Abstulit clarum cita mors Achillem”—</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">we seldom hear a word about the inferior souls who are deprived of their
terrestrial tenements by the boiling Kochbrunnen, Ursprung, or Sprudel.
And, when a great man actually falls a sacrifice, sufficient mischief is done
before his death, by his example and recommendation. It is well known
that the Duke of Nassau’s preference of the Kissengen waters to those of
his own Wisbaden, drew many illustrious patients to the former springs,
who would have been contented with the latter. That the hot mineral
baths produce a powerful effect even in health, and still more in disease,
we have ample proofs. We need only take the testimony of my friend
Dr. Granville himself, who will not be suspected of any prejudice or timidity
in respect to these agents. “One of the first effects of the hot water
bath at Baden (and I may say the same of Toplitz, Carlsbad, Wisbaden,
&amp;c.) produced on me, was an almost irresistible inclination to fall asleep.
To resist this is of the utmost consequence.” “The operation of bathing
in water endowed with much power, from heat and other circumstances,
is not to be viewed lightly. Much mischief has arisen—nay, fatal results
have followed, from its indiscriminate adoption. A rich merchant, who,
but a few hours before, had been noticed on the public promenade after
dinner, on the day after our arrival, was found dead in a bath at 8 o’clock
of the same evening. A lady was pointed out to me, who had lost the
use of her limbs after using three hot baths.”</p>

<p>The injurious effects of hot baths, even of common water, are daily
witnessed at home—and these agents are still more powerful abroad. Their
physiological effects on the normal or healthy constitution, as mentioned
above, by Dr. Granville, I certainly did not experience in my own person;
but this might be from the thickness of my skull, the hardness of my brain,
or the weakness of my circulation. The sensations produced by these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
baths were always of the most pleasant kind, with far more disposition to
ruminate than to sleep. In these effects, indeed, consists much of the
danger. There are few diseases, however unsuited for hot bathing, that
do not appear to be soothed or mitigated, at first, by this agent—and this
apparent relief throws the practitioner off his guard, and leads the patient
to extol the remedy, and persevere in the hazardous experiment, till the
mischief actually occurs. There is, in truth, much less danger from improper
drinking of mineral waters, than bathing in the same. The stomach
or other organs are pretty sure to give ample notice of approaching
injury from the imprudent use of mineral waters internally taken. Not
so in the case of bathing. While the train of destruction is preparing—nay,
at the moment when the match is applied to the train, the victim is
lulled into a fatal security, not only by the absence of painful feelings,
but by the positive induction of sensations the most pleasurable.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to reiterate the precautions already stated in other
places, as to the use of warm and hot bathing here. Rheumatic, gouty,
paralytic, and cutaneous affections are those which can reap much benefit
from the <span class="smcap">Ursprung</span>—and, in these cases, all inflammatory and congestive
states of the constitution, as well as of particular organs, should be carefully
removed, before the waters are used, either internally or externally.</p>

<p>It would be easy to resuscitate ample testimonies, lay and professional,
to the <i>miraculous</i> efficacy of the <span class="smcap">Baden</span> springs, in all diseases, curable
and incurable. An attendance among the fragments of antiquity round
the Ursprung must convince the most credulous that <span class="smcap">Baden</span>, as I said
before, is not the Pool of Bethesda, as far as its healing virtues are concerned,
though its waters are daily “troubled” by angels somewhat different
from those that descended, for benevolent purposes, near the Holy
City. <span class="smcap">Baden</span> is, in fine, neither more nor less than a fashionable place of
pleasure, dissipation, vice, and gambling—abounding in hot-baths, hells,
hotels, scandal, and good scenery.</p>

<p>The last item in the above list has been most grossly exaggerated, as
any one will acknowledge who has visited the place and compared its
scenery with the following bombast.</p>

<p>“The surpassing <i>grandeur</i> of the scenery has been so constantly dwelt
upon, that the hopeless task of description is unnecessary. Should you
love all that is <i>awful</i>, sombre, wild, and <i>grand</i> in scenery, wander but <i>half
a mile</i> from town, and you may be lost amid the dark valleys that wind
through the pine-covered mountains.”—<i>Mrs. Trollope.</i></p>

<p>Now I most positively deny that there is anything either grand, or
awful, or sublime, in the scenery of Baden. The valley is picturesque,
romantic, or even beautiful—and the view from the ruins of the old castle
(rather more than half-a-mile, by the way, from the town) is extensive
and very fine; but the sublime and the awful do not enter into the composition
of Baden scenery. You must wander among the Alps for these.</p>

<p>Lest I should be suspected of taking a cynical view of Baden-Baden,
I shall adduce the following quotations from Dr. Granville.</p>

<p>“Here men, as well as women, took their places at, or stood round,
the several tables of “<span class="smcap">roulette</span>” and “<span class="smcap">rouge-et-noir</span>,” which were
in full play. One only remark I will venture to make in reference to this
subject—and that remark will be an expression of deep sorrow, at having
observed the daughters of Englishmen, to all appearance highly respectable,
joining the circle of such as pressed round the tables, to stake their
<i>petite pieces</i>, and be elbowed by some rude fellow-gambler, who had probably
as little character as he had money to lose.”</p>

<p>I am happy to say that in the interval between 1834 and 1839, when
I last visited Baden, some improvement seemed to have taken place in
this respect, especially among our fair countrywomen. I saw very few of
them in the act of gambling, but the sight of such scenes—during the
whole of the Sabbath day—is most injurious to our youth of both sexes!
I cannot say so much for the balls in the evening. They are the same
now as when Dr. Granville wrote.</p>

<p>“Away whirled the galoppe-dancers in giddy circles, until the very
breathing of the fair partners became audible, and their countenances lost
all traces of placid loveliness. And the rude grasp and <i>étroite liaison</i>,
during such dances—do they become the modest nature of an Englishwoman—or
of any woman? Oh, it grieved me to see the graceful—elancé—and
exquisitely elegant Mrs. M——, at the slightest invitation
from a booted hussar, or an embroidered <i>attaché</i>, or a disguised
<i>vaurien</i> of the lowest class, plunge with them into all the attitudes,
now violent, and now languishing, of a dance better suited for bacchanalian
or Andalusian representation! And she bore on her alabaster and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
shining cheek, the deep round flush of consumption, which parched her
lips, and made her fly, at the termination of each performance, to the refreshment-room
with her partner—there to quench, with perilous experiment,
the inward fever, by an ice dissolved in freezing water; while the
big drops of moisture stood on her forehead, or trickled down her face,
increasing the general disorder of her appearance.”</p>

<p>Yes! The <span class="smcap">roulette</span> and the <span class="smcap">waltz</span> are the veritable “normal schools
of <i>agitation</i>” for the sons and daughters of the nobility and gentry of the—happy,
pious, and Protestant England!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 id="WILDBAD">WILDBAD,<br />
OR THE ELYSIAN FOUNTAIN OF THE BLACK FOREST.</h3>

<p>The glowing description of this mineral spring, and the all but magical
effects of its baths on the human frame, as given by Dr. Granville, have
led hundreds of additional visitors to the sequestered valley of the Enz—some
in quest of health, but many to satisfy curiosity, and test the picture
which has been drawn in such flattering colours by the talented author of
the “<span class="smcap">Spas of Germany</span>.” The difficulties, however, which Dr. Granville
experienced in his journey from Baden-Baden to Wildbad, must have
deterred a great number of spa-tourists from visiting the Elysian fountain
of the Black Forest. The journey occupied thirty hours, including one
whole night on the road. We accomplished it in eight hours, by an excellent
road, with the same pair of horses, and with ample leisure to lunch
and rest midway. This route lies through some of the most beautiful,
picturesque, and romantic scenery on the Continent. It is only thirty
English miles, six or seven of which Dr. Granville pursued, when by some
strange intelligence or mistake, he turned to the <i>right</i>, at Guernsbach,
and went <i>wrong</i> all the rest of the way.</p>

<p>Sick of the frivolities and dissipations of Baden-Baden, we started at
eight o’clock in the morning for Wildbad; and, wending our course up a
steep acclivity, everywhere covered with pines, we passed the <i>Mercurius
Berg</i>, with its altar dedicated to the god of thieves—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Calidum quicquid placuit jocoso</div>
<div class="verse indent9">condere furto”—</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">just as the Romans had left it, together with the frowning ruins of Eberstein,
where thievery rose to the rank of robbery, and was christened
under the high-sounding title of <span class="smcap">Feudalism</span>! The higher we ascended,
the denser became the woods, and the darker the road. There is something
peculiarly sombre and solemn in the pineries of the Schwartswald,
through many parts of which I had formerly journeyed. The vast extent
of the forest, the great number and altitude of the hills and mountains,
the gigantic growth and height of the trees, the darkness of the foliage,
and the intensity of the silence, occasionally augmented rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
broken by the distant and scarcely audible stroke of the woodman’s
axe, all combine to form a scene of solitude well adapted for contemplation
and reflection.</p>

<p>After an hour’s labour, we gained an open space, when the eye has an
opportunity of ranging over a sea of peaks and mountains to the South
and East, all clothed in the dark green livery of the pine to their utmost
summits. To the North and West the prospect was nearly as unlimited as
from the Alte-Schloss, from Radstad and the Rhine up the valley of the
Mourg to Guernsbach, which seemed like a white speck on the river at a
prodigious depth below us. Down to this little town we cautiously slid,
with drags on the wheels, winding in serpentine courses, often along the
brinks of dangerous ravines, but every little vale or valley cultivated till
the forest forbad the plough, the spade, and the scythe. The little town of
Guernsbach, built on both sides of the Mourg, with a good bridge across,
contains nearly two thousand inhabitants—almost all of whom live <i>by</i> the
produce of the mountains, and a good number of the poorer classes <i>in</i> the
woods themselves. Here the raftlets and rafts are seen descending to the
Rhine, afterwards to aggregate into flotillas carrying hundreds of rowers,
steerers, and navigators,—and conveying the Black Forest into the flats of
Holland. But a little farther on, I shall take more notice of this immense
traffic and source of wealth. The Castle of Eberstein and the church
crown the heights over the town. Here Dr. Granville, instead of crossing
the bridge, turned up along the banks of the Mourg, and had to go all the
way to Stuttgardt, on his way to Wildbad.</p>

<p>From Guernsbach we ascended another lofty mountain to the romantic
village of Laffenau. The prospect of the valley of the Mourg, with
Guernsbach on its banks, and a sea of pine-clad heights in every direction,
is most beautiful. Near Laffenau we have the “<span class="smcap">Teufels Muhle</span>,” or
Devil’s Mill, with its legendary tale—briefly as follows:—</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Prince of Darkness</span> took it into his head, once on a time, to
turn parson, and to preach from a chair or pulpit, still called by the name
of that right reverend divine. His audience became more numerous than
enlightened, when an angel, from quite a different quarter, pitched his tent
on a neighbouring peak, and held forth in opposition to the man in black.
The eloquence of the new preacher drew away great numbers from the old.
Satan, in hopes of disturbing the congregation of his rival, vented his rage
in some caverns in the rock, and in growls and groans that resembled
thunder. But still the audience of the new preacher multiplied. This
was more than any preacher, human or divine, could bear; and the old
gentleman forthwith built himself a mill, the noise of which, together with
the <i>diabolical</i> hootings, yells, and howlings of the miller and his men, he
hoped would distract the audience of the orthodox ecclesiastic. Even this
would not do, and his reverence of the cloven foot and long tail betook
himself from words to things. He hurled masses of rock across the valley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
against the successful candidate for popular applause, with as much ease
as a man would pitch quoits. This was “too bad;” and therefore a bolt
from Heaven was directed against this teacher of impieties which demolished
the mill, and prostrated the miller and his crew amongst the ruins!
The disturber of the peace fell with such force among the rocks that the
print of his body remains evident to the present hour.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The tale may be false, or the tale may be true,</div>
<div class="verse">As I heard it myself, I relate it to you.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The legend concludes with one piece of intelligence, to the truth of
which most people will assent: namely, that after the above event, the
arch enemy has seldom ventured to hold forth from the pulpit, <i>in propria
persona</i>, but has employed a great number of emissaries in human shape,
who disseminate among mankind, and some of them <i>ex cathedra</i>, too, those
“false doctrines, heresies, and schisms,” which scandalize the church and
cause dissensions among the people.</p>

<p>With the exception of a few miles, the whole route from Baden-Baden
to Nuenburg, is a series of steep mountains and narrow valleys, presenting
the greatest variety of scenery, from the picturesque and beautiful, up
to the romantic, wild, and savage character. A thunder-storm, with heavy
rain the preceding night—and now a beautiful day, with brilliant sun, gave
us every advantage; while the mountain air, with active and passive exercise
in alternation, produced, at once, sensations of health and hunger, so
little felt in the close and deep valley of dissipation which we had left
behind us at Baden.</p>

<h4>SCHWEIN-GENERAL.</h4>

<p>It was on the summit of a lofty mountain between Laffenau and Herrenalb,
that we fell in with one of those generals, or, I should rather say,
<i>field</i>-marshals, (immortalized by the “Old Man of the Brunnens”) who,
with three or four aid-de-camps, was marching and manœuvering a
“swinish multitude” of raw recruits among these alpine heights. They
were evidently less a fighting than a foraging party, levying contributions
on every thing edible in these sombre pineries. It was also manifest that,
whether from the morning air or the supperless night, they were by no
means over nice, either in their olfactory or gustatory senses; for nothing
seemed to come amiss to them, or to prove unsavoury or indigestible. But
although provender turned up at almost every step, they were a grumbling
and grunting, as well as an awkward squad, and so prone to predatory excursions,
that the schwein-general and his staff were constantly flogging
them into the regular ranks. Their long legs and lank sides shewed that
their fare was not of the most fattening nature—or, that they had little
else than predatory rations to live upon. They had been called out early
that morning, by bugle and horn, from their various bivouacs in Laffenau,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
with more appetite than order, for their mountain drill. The general (or
field-marshal) with his aid-de-camps, and some vigilant videttes, of the
canine species, had no small difficulty in compelling their guerilla corps of
maurauders to keep “close order;” for they were constantly deploying to
the right and to the left—shooting a-head—or straggling in the rear, despite
the proclamations of the general, the stripes of the subalterns, and the biting
rebuffs of the quadrupeds, who, ever and anon, <i>lugged</i> back into the ranks
some long-faced and bleeding deserter, amid the grunts and groans of his
sympathising companions, on whom, however, these summary sentences of
a drum-head, or rather mountain-head, court-martial appeared to make
but a transient impression.</p>

<p>On taking leave of General Swein, I could not help making some
“odious comparisons” between him and some other generals, “<i>melioris
notæ</i>,” in various parts, and at various epochs of this world. <span class="smcap">He</span> did not,
like too many of his order, lay villages in ashes, and massacre the inhabitants
when rushing from the flames—or deliver their wives and daughters
to the tender mercies of an enfuriate soldiery—<span class="smcap">he</span> did not murder his
prisoners in cool blood, by nailing them to trees, as marks for an undisciplined
rabble of fanatic banditti to exercise their muskets—<span class="smcap">he</span> did not drag
citizens of a free state from their homes, and consign them to the mines
and wilds of Hyperborean regions—<span class="smcap">he</span> did not mock the forms of <span class="smcap">Heavenly</span>
justice, and slaughter the victims of his ambition or revenge in the
fosse or on the glacis—<span class="smcap">he</span> did not turn the fertile district into a frightful
desert, as the effectual means of ensuring peace—(“ubi solitudinem faciunt,
pacem vocant”)—<span class="smcap">he</span> did not perform these or any similar exploits,
and, <i>therefore</i>, he has had no pious advocate to justify his crimes, or impartial
historian to record his virtues!</p>

<p>Descending by a long and zig-zag road from the Swine-General’s camp,
we arrive at <span class="smcap">Herrenalb</span>, situated in a romantic glen, enclosed by lofty
mountains. Here we lunched, and rested our horses, who certainly had
better fare than their masters. Black bread, bad butter, hard eggs, and
chopped hay for tea, were devoured without grumbling, in consequence
of the canine appetite acquired on the alpine heights. On leaving
Herrenalb, we pass on our left, one of the most singular and fantastic
groups of basaltic rocks which I have anywhere seen. They appear like
a gigantic fortress, with buttresses and embrasures. A traveller has remarked
of these productions of subterranean fire, that—“on croirait qu’une
imagination fantastique a presidé a leur formation.” They probably issued
from a deep-seated volcano, in the form of molten lava, at the time when
Staffa and the Giant’s Causeway rose from the bowels of the earth, and
congealed in pillars on the shores of Antrim and Argyll.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Firm on its rocky base each pillar stands—</div>
<div class="verse">No chissel’d shaft, no work of mortal hands.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Ere man had ceased in savage woods to dwell—</div>
<div class="verse">Roots for his food, his drink the crystal well;</div>
<div class="verse">Ere cities grew, or Parian marble shown,</div>
<div class="verse">Yon columns stood—and stand while they are gone.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From these “fragments of an earlier world,” these real monuments of
antiquity, compared with which, the Pyramids of Egypt are as mushrooms
of yesterday, and whose rugged brows the rains and tempests of ten
thousand years have not yet smoothed, we ascended to a great height, and
reached a comparatively open and partially cultivated country, between
<span class="smcap">Frauenalb</span> on the left, and <span class="smcap">Rothensal</span> on the right. This alpine
plateau continued for six or seven miles—the prospect towards the North
and West being of great extent, over a fine champaigne country which,
from this altitude, appeared like an immense plain. The South and East
presented a vast sea of mighty mountains, the insurgent billows of which
were feathered with perennial forests. After doubling the North-western
extremity of a high alpine ridge, we turned short round to the right—plunged
into a deep wood—and descended quickly by a precipitous route
to the town of <span class="smcap">Nuenburg</span>, situated on the foaming Enz, in a narrow and
gloomy valley. Here we got black bread and water for the horses, and
Seltzer water with wine for ourselves. While the horses were resting,
we scrambled up to the ancient chateau, now occupied by the foresters.
From this there is a good view of the valley of the Enz, for a few miles
above and below the town. The valley is here not more than five or six
hundred yards broad at the bottom, with the river in the centre, and the
pine mountains rising abruptly on both sides. We had now about eight
miles to Wildbad, close along the right bank of the river, and consequently
with only a gentle ascent the whole way.</p>

<p>The valley of Wildbad, between Nuenburg and the town of Wildbad,
is about 1400 feet above the level of the sea—and the mountains on each
side about 1500 above the river. It resembles a good deal the <i>Vallée
d’Enfer</i>, well known to most travellers. There is but a narrow border of
cultivated ground on each side of the Enz—in some places not exceeding
two or three hundred yards—in others, creeping up the steep acclivities
nearly a quarter of a mile. Hay, corn, and potatoes are the chief productions
of the valley. The pine occupies every slope not cultivated; the
forest, on each side, presenting a serrated border, the salient angles sometimes
coming nearly down to the banks of the stream—the interspaces
being occupied with potatoes or some culinary vegetable. But the Enz
itself presents more bustle and activity than its banks. Small and precipitous
as is the torrent, it is made to carry the mountains—or at least
their forests, on its slender back. The flotteurs or rafters are a race and
craft distinct from the wood-cutters, who hew the trees in the mountains,
and hurl them down their steep sides to the river. The Enz falls 370 feet
in the short distance of nine miles between Wildbad and Nuenburg, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
yet they manage to float down numerous rafts, or rather raftlets, two or
three hundred feet in length, along this trajet. The method is simple
but ingenious. At convenient distances, dikes or dams are run diagonally
across the stream, with a sluice or flood-gate in the centre. When the
gate is shut, the back-water accumulates so as to float the raft from the
next dam higher up. The rafts are narrow, but very long and jointed.
When one, two, or more have arrived at the dam, the head of the raft is
brought close to the sluice—the gate is opened—and away darts the raft,
with a loud noise and fracas—dashing against the rocks—each joint, as
it passes over the dam, rising up like the dorsal fin of a huge whale rolling
about in the sea. In this way they are conveyed from the mountains
to the Rhine—the raftlets augmenting in breadth, or number of trees, in
proportion as the stream augments and enlarges into a river. As every
mountain must have a valley, so every valley must have a rivulet. However
small the stream, it can be dammed so as to float one tree at a time—and
when contributary streamlets from the mountains enlarge the parent
stream, the raftlets increase in size also. Thus the main wealth of
Wildbad is constantly floating down the Enz, consigned to distant countries,
but leaving profit for the merchant, and affording employment for
thousands and thousands of the industrious poor. The raftlets grown
into rafts, having arrived at the Rhine, change hands, and the local
boucherons, or floaters, return to their native valleys to renew their labours
from spring till the approach of winter. The aggregated rafts now become
<span class="smcap">flotillas</span>, capable of bearing an army on their backs, and actually
inhabited by four or five hundred—not seamen but raftmen, while they
glide down the majestic stream of the Rhine.</p>

<p>Let us see whether this animated scene of industry, hilarity, and wealth
has any back-ground to the picture—any alloy to the pure metal. Many
a gaudy tissue, embroidered robe, and sparkling gem, has been produced
by sordid hands, amidst penury, disease, and despair! The wood-cutter
of the Black Forest mountains leads a gloomy and miserable life. His
labour is eternally the same—affording no food or reflection for the mind—the
workmen being secluded in dark and dreary forests for days, weeks,
and months, without any communication with their families; while their
children are entirely neglected, as far as education is concerned! They
are, as it were, cut off from human society—become morose, taciturn,
melancholic—or even misanthropic. What is worse, they are frequently
brought home maimed, lamed, or stricken with some dangerous or fatal
disease! They almost always die prematurely. Yet the facility of gaining
a livelihood by cutting and floating wood, leaves very few inhabitants
of this valley inclined to pursue any mechanical occupation. The trees,
when felled and the branches lopped off, are dragged in traineaus to the
edges of the declivities, from whence they descend along cleared tracks,
or a kind of wooden tunnel, by their own weight, to the vicinity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
river. A little field of potatoes—a wooden hut—a couple of goats to feed
the children—and a pig to be killed at Christmas—constitute the whole
riches of the woodman, whether of mountain or valley.</p>

<p>After a very pleasant drive of nine miles along the right bank of the Enz,
we came suddenly upon the little town of Wildbad, now celebrated for
the divine effects of its baths on the human frame. The town contains
279 inhabited houses, and 115 buildings of other kinds. It is nearly
equally divided by the foaming little Enz, the backs of houses, on each
side of the valley, being actually built against the feet of the mountains.
As these are some 1500 feet high, an hour, at least, of the rising, and
another of the setting sun, are unseen and unfelt in Wildbad—except in
the curious phenomenon of the sunshine creeping down the western mountain
in the morning, and up the eastern mountain in the evening.</p>

<p>The valley of Wildbad lies nearly North and South, and consequently
the winds are felt only in those two directions. The temperature of the
atmosphere necessarily varies considerably, but cold prevails over heat.
Snow ordinarily lurks on the summits of the mountains from the middle
of November till the middle of May. From the first of July till the middle
of August, the heat is generally great. “In a hot summer (says Professor
Heim) the temperature is almost insupportable about mid-day, when the
breeze is scarcely perceptible in the depth of the valley.” In June, July,
and August, the thermometer in Wildbad mounts occasionally to 90, in
the hottest days—and falls correspondingly in the winter. In the season
(months of June, July, August, and September) of 1834, there were 47
clear days—five thunder-storms—and 34 rainy days. In 1837—35 clear
days—44 rainy days—and 11 thunder-storms. During the years 1834-5-6
and 7, the mean temperature of the four summer months, at mid-day,
was 66° of Fahrenheit, which is very moderate. Lightning has never
struck any of the houses in Wildbad—the contiguous mountains proving
excellent conductors. There are no peculiar diseases at Wildbad, except
those produced by scanty food and hard labour. Scarcely any goitres or
cretins are seen here. The inhabitants hardly ever take any other medicines
than the warm waters of the place. Doctors would inevitably starve
here, were it not for the foreign visitors. The water of Wildbad is excellent,
both for cooking and drinking. Pulmonary complaints are exceedingly
rare in this valley, and indeed in the Black Forest generally. The
same may be said of goitre and cretinism.</p>

<p>We took up our quarters at the <span class="smcap">Bear</span>, exactly opposite the baths, and
had no reason to complain of our accommodations in this hotel. My
chamber was in the back of the house, just over the noisy little Enz; but
its murmurings only lulled me to a sound sleep, after the keen mountain
air, and the healthy exercise of the day.</p>

<p>It is only within these few years that Wildbad has become much known,
through the writings of Drs. Flicker and Granville. Professor Heim has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
now added to the means of its publicity. In 1830, the number of bathers
was 470—in 1837, 1,003—in 1838, the number was 1,235. In this list,
the real bathers and drinkers only are inscribed. The mere passengers of
a day or two are omitted. In 1837, there were only ten English, who
used the waters. In 1838, there were 130. In 1839, about the middle
of August, when I was there, the number had still encreased. The
accommodations hitherto have been insufficient. In this year, 1840, a
new and grand edifice will be completed, capable of contributing to the
comfort—would that it may not add to the gambling luxury or destruction
of—a large number of visitors! The <span class="smcap">Palace</span>, which is close to the
baths, is open to the public—in fact, it is a hotel, for the refreshment of
body and mind. It would be unjust, not to commemorate here the wise,
salutary, and beneficent injunction against <span class="smcap">gambling</span>, which is rigorously
enforced by the government. May it continue in force, <i>per omnia secula
seculorum</i>!</p>

<p>The warm baths of Wildbad issue from several sources in the granite
rock; but are collected into four basins, isolated from each other, and
under particular regulations. Just opposite the Bear Hotel is the place
for drinking the waters, a few feet below the surface of the square or
market-place. There are two spouts, and I observed for two hours the
devotees of this Hygeian spring. I should have little hesitation in swearing
that there was not a single malingerer (to use a military phrase for
one who <i>feigns</i> disease,) in the whole group, amounting to about sixty or
eighty. They all bore intrinsic marks of indisposition; but the maimed,
the lame, the paralytic, and the rheumatic, constituted nine-tenths of the
assemblage. I had an early note from Professor Heim, politely offering
to shew me the baths. With him I proceeded to the <span class="smcap">Furstenbad</span>, or
Prince’s Bath, in which Dr. Granville bathed. On entering the <span class="smcap">Bad</span>, I
found it occupied by two persons—one quite naked, the other with white
drawers on—while Dr. Fricker, who stood on the steps with a watch in
his hand, was directing the operations. I naturally shrunk back, with an
apology for intruding; but my kind and honest friend, Dr. Heim, pushed
me forward, observing, that there was “no offence.” The bather was a
Russian General, Comte ——, and he who sat behind him in the bath,
rubbing his back, was the bad-meister. I entered into conversation with
the General and his medical director, and found them agreeable, intelligent,
and frank communicants. The douche having been applied, and
the bathing process finished, I withdrew for a quarter of an hour, while
the bath was preparing for myself. Most of my readers must have read
or heard of these celebrated waters by Dr. Granville, and I must here
record his account of the surprising sensations which they produce on the
human frame immersed in them.</p>

<p>“After descending a few steps from the dressing-room into the bath-room,
I walked over the warm soft sand to the farthest end of the bath,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and I laid myself down upon it, near the principal spring, resting my head
on a clean wooden pillow. The soothing effect of the water as it came
over me, up to the throat, transparent like the brightest gem or aquamarine,
soft, genially warm, and gently murmuring, I shall never forget.
Millions of bubbles of gas rose from the sand, and played around me,
quivering through the lucid water as they ascended, and bursting at the
surface to be succeeded by others. The sensation produced by these, as
many of them, with their tremulous motion, just <i>effleuraient</i> the surface of
the body, like the much vaunted effect of titillation in animal magnetism,
is not to be described. <i>It partakes of tranquillity and exhilaration; of the
ecstatic state of a devotee, blended with the repose of an opium eater. The
head is calm, the heart is calm, every sense is calm; yet there is neither
drowsiness, stupefaction, nor numbness; for every feeling is fresher, and the
memory of worldly pleasures keen and sharp.</i> But the operations of the
moral as well as physical man are under the spell of some powerfully tranquillising
agent. It is the human tempest lulled into all the delicious
playings of the ocean’s after-waves. From such a position I willingly
would never have stirred. To prolong its delicious effects what would I
not have given! but the bad-meister appeared at the top of the steps of
the farther door, and warned me to eschew the danger of my situation;
for there is danger even in such pleasures as these, if greatly prolonged.</p>

<p>“I looked at the watch and the thermometer before I quitted my station.
The one told me I had passed a whole hour, in the few minutes I had
spent according to my imagination; and the other marked 29½° of Reaumur,
or 98¼° of Fahrenheit. But I found the temperature warmer than
that, whenever, with my hand, I dug into the bed of sand, as far down as
the rock, and disengaged myriads of bubbles of heated air, which imparted
to the skin a satiny softness not to be observed in the effects of
ordinary warm baths.</p>

<p>“These baths are principally used from five o’clock in the morning
until seven, and even much later; and again by some people in the evening.
The time allowed for remaining in the water is from half an hour
to an hour; but it is held to be imprudent to continue the bath to the
latter period, as experience has shown that such sensations as I felt, and
have endeavoured to describe, prove ultimately too overpowering to the
constitution, if prolonged to excess.”<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Kerner, who preceded Dr. Granville, makes use of the following
expressions, quoted by the latter author.</p>

<p>“The use of the Wildbad waters cannot be too much commended.
They serve, indeed, <i>to make the old young again</i>; while younger persons,
who have become prematurely old, owing to exhaustion, and those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
are exhausted by close application and incessant fatigue, <i>rise out of these
baths with new strength and youth</i>.”</p>

<p>Although I called to mind these identical expressions, as applied by
Dr. Fenner to the Serpent’s Bath at Schlangenbad, and remembered also
my disappointment; yet I could not divest myself of the pleasing anticipations
that Wildbad would realize the effects recorded by my friend
Dr. Granville, and that I should retreat from this romantic valley at least
ten years younger than when I entered it. I dispensed with the attendance
of the bad-meister—locked the door—descended into the bath—and creeping
to the identical spot where Dr. Granville experienced the “ecstatic
state of a devotee, blended with the repose of an opium-eater,” I waited,
not without some impatience, the advent of this fore-taste of Paradise.
But no such good fortune awaited me! I eyed the gas bubbles that rose
around me, not indeed “in millions,” nor even in dozens—but so sparingly
that I could have easily numbered them, eager though they had been to
“quiver through the lucid water” in their ascent to greet my friend and
confrere a few years previously. With every wish to be pleased, and with
the most minute attention to my own sensations, I must confess that
I experienced no effects from the waters of Wildbad, other than I did
from baths of similar temperature and composition, as those of Schlangenbad,
Baden, and Pfeffers.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> They have the same advantage as the
Pfeffers, in maintaining the same temperature, however long we may remain
in them—the stream running in and out of the baths. Whether
this may not sometimes tempt the bad-meisters to save the trouble and
time of emptying the baths after each bather, I do not profess to know.
With respect to the bed of warm sand at the bottom, I think it is more
pleasant to the feelings than to the imagination. It is impossible that <i>it</i>
can be changed; and the idea of lying down in a bed which a leper may
have just left, is not the most pleasant in the world. For myself, I should
prefer the clean marble, or even the wood to this substratum of sand. It
is but justice to state, that there is a rule for all persons to go through the
quarantine of a plain bath before commencing the medicinal. Such a rule,
however, was not imposed upon me—nor I believe, on the generality of
casual bathers. I stayed in the bath half an hour, and felt exceedingly
refreshed by it. I have no hesitation, therefore, in giving it as my opinion
that the waters of Wildbad are inferior to none, in their medicinal agency,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
as baths of a non-stimulant and simple kind. Their improper use is not
nearly so hazardous as those of Wisbaden, Kissengen, or Carlsbad, whose
saline ingredients act powerfully on the sentient extremities of the nerves of
the skin, and too often excite dangerous commotions in the animal economy.</p>

<p>In the course of the day I fell in with my bath acquaintance, Count
——, the Russian General, and had a long conversation with him. He
had been in the memorable campaign of 1812, and had, for some years,
laboured under a paralytic affection of the lower extremities. He assured
me that in four or five weeks of these baths and douches, he had regained
a good deal of power in his limbs; but his general strength had decreased,
and he was about to repair to Schwalbach, in hopes that the chalybeate
springs there would invigorate his constitution. We had a polite invitation
to a fête at the palace that evening, from the gallant General.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>In respect to the “bathing in company,” I confess I have a repugnance
to it on many accounts, only one of which I shall state. The pleasure of
conversation, in such places, is dearly purchased by the impossibility, (for
the bather must go in a light dress,) of employing friction and shampooing
on the naked surface—one of the greatest luxuries and salutary processes
that can possibly be practised in warm-baths of any kind. This objection
alone is entirely fatal to the “community of bathing,” laying aside the
indelicacy of the thing.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>The douches are easily and simply performed by a kind of pump and
hose, by which the warm water is directed against any part of the body,
and with any degree of force. A new source was discovered last year,
near the Furstenbad, which will greatly extend the means of bathing singly.
Already the refuse waters from the baths are sufficient to turn a mill as
they run out from the baths to the Enz—the river never freezing in the
town.</p>

<p>In chemical and physical properties, the waters of Wildbad closely resemble
those of Pfeffers and Schlangenbad. They are clear and odourless;
but have a mawkish taste. In a pint, Professor Sigwart found 3½
grains of saline matters, of which nearly 2 grains were common salt—half
a grain of carbonate of soda—and nearly the same of sulphate of
soda. The other ingredients are chips in porridge, if we except a mere
trace of iron. When boiled, it disengages a very trifling quantity of carbonic
acid gas. The air which bubbles up from the waters contains (according
to Gaeger and Gaertner) five parts of carbonic acid—7 of oxygen—and
88 of azote. Since that analysis, it has been found that there is
little or no oxygen in the air. The temperature varies in the different
sources from 88° to 99° of Fahrenheit. It is quite independent of summer,
winter, storms, or calms.</p>

<p>When waters, so simple as scarcely to differ from the purest spring
used for drink, produce medicinal effects, the cause is attributed to some
mysterious power, incognizable by the senses and inimitable by human art.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Arcana Dei miraculis plena.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Professor Heim takes up the same hypothesis as others before him, and
Dr. Granville among the rest, that the caloric of mineral waters is of a
<i>specific</i> kind, analogous to the vital heat of the body. “It is a heat incorporated
with the water by a chemico-vital process.” “And as no external
warmth can supply the body with <i>vital</i> heat, so no artificially created
temperature can be a real substitute for the natural heat of thermal
springs.”</p>

<p>The temperature, then, of the Wildbad waters being that of the human
blood, immersion in them produces but a slight sensation of heat, the surface
of our bodies being below that of our blood in temperature. The
sensation is that of <i>comfort</i>—a word not to be more nearly translated into
French than by the term “<i>bien-être</i>.” Here Professor Heim quotes, of
course, Dr. Granville’s description of the “ecstatic” feelings which he experienced
in these waters. He adds:—“But another circumstance which,
more than all the rest, conduces to this favourable impression, is the <i>dynamic
combination</i> (le lien dynamique) of the solid and gaseous elements—the
spirit of the water—received from the hand of Nature, in the bowels
of the earth. It is this general impression on the whole human organism,
which effects the cure of divers sufferings and maladies, by awakening and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
reviving the vital powers enfeebled or prostrated—and thus restoring activity
to the circulation and to the nervous system, through which a reaction
and energy is communicated to all the functions of the body.”</p>

<p>These effects, Prof. Heim acknowledges, cannot be accounted for by
the chemical composition of the water. The cosmetic qualities of Wildbad
and Schlangenbad, he thinks, may be <i>partly</i> owing to the soda contained
in them, which forms a kind of oily soap on the surface, and gives
it that feeling of lubricity and softness, so much vaunted: but he believes
it to be <i>principally</i> owing to the peculiar power of the bath to invigorate the
functions of the skin as well as of the internal organs—a power greater,
he maintains, in the waters of Wildbad than of Schlangenbad.</p>

<p>Although these waters generally produce an exciting or exhilarating
effect, yet in a certain number of instances, they cause a sense of lassitude
and heaviness in the extremities, with an inclination to sleep, especially
after leaving the bath. These effects are commonly attributable to improper
use of the baths, or staying too long in them, in consequence of
the pleasant feelings derived from them. Dr. H. recommends all persons
to stay but 10 or 15 minutes in the bath at first, gradually increasing the
time to half or three-quarters of an hour. In some, the head is affected
with vertigo—in others, there is oppression on the chest—all which soon
go off, after five or six baths.</p>

<p>“It is to be remembered that a majority of the bathers experience the
‘reaction fever’ (fièvre de réaction) in the course of the treatment. The
period of its occurrence is uncertain, and often it is so slight as to pass
almost unobserved by the patient. This, however, is the critical moment
precursory of the cure. This state of irritation seldom lasts more than a
few days, and generally disappears without any internal medicine. This
reaction is precisely that which ought to inspire the greatest hopes in the
patient, as it announces a change in his constitution, and a victory over
his malady. The disagreeable sensations, however, which he feels, often
puts him out of humour with the baths, especially if old pains and discomforts,
that had ceased, now re-appear, which they often do. He becomes
impatient and morose, when he is re-visited by rheumatic pains,
neuralgia, gout, hæmorrhoids, &amp;c. which he had thought to be extinct.
Such re-action, however, is indispensable towards the victory of nature and
the baths over the disease for which they were employed. The waters of
Wildbad, indeed, are remarkable for this reproduction of old disorders, at
the moment they are eradicating the more recent ones.”</p>

<p>These most important properties of the waters of Wildbad are passed
entirely unnoticed by Dr. Granville, and from my own knowledge, several
English have left Wildbad, at the very time they were on the point of experiencing
the greatest benefits. This reaction or bath-fever, is common,
as I have shewn, to most of the medicinal waters, as was seen under the
head of Wisbaden, Kissengen, &amp;c. At the former place I saw several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
well-marked instances of it, and satisfied myself of its reality. I have not
found any description of it in the accounts of the German Spas published
in England. It is a subject of the greatest importance to the invalid.</p>

<p>The following case is related by Dr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>, formerly director of these
baths. I have greatly abridged it.</p>

<p>“An officer, aged 26 years, fell down a flight of stone stairs, and
pitched on the right haunch, or hip-bone. He was stunned to insensibility,
from which he slowly recovered. When examined, the right leg
and thigh were cold as ice, but no fracture or dislocation could be discovered.
He was confined several weeks to his bed; and then could
only hobble about on crutches with great pain. At length he was able to
dispense with the crutches, but every motion of the limb caused great
agony. He tried the waters and baths of Wisbaden; but experienced no
benefit. Thirteen months after the accident, and when the excruciating
pains had rather gained than lost force, he came to Wildbad. The first
bath produced no sensible effect. The second called forth some pains in
the loins, where he had felt no inconvenience previously. These augmented
after the third bath till the seventh, when they became so violent,
that he could not stand, and was confined to his bed. At this time he
suddenly experienced a most painful sense of coldness in the right foot,
which was succeeded by heat, reaction, and ultimately a profuse perspiration
over the whole limb, and even in the loins. From that time he was able
to move the leg without pain, and quickly regained the power of walking
without a stick.”</p>

<p>The Wildbad baths are celebrated for the removal of those various
pains and aches which not seldom attend old gunshot and other wounds.
A case is related of an officer who had been wounded in the arm by a
musket-ball in the late war, and who was harassed by pains in the site of
the wound for many years afterwards. The use of the Wildbad baths re-opened
the wound, from whence a piece of flannel was discharged, and
the pains ceased.</p>

<p>These waters are considered to be specific in certain female complaints
which are difficult of removal, and subversive of health, in too
many instances.</p>

<p>“La proprieté de rajeunir, que les dames vantent tant dans le bain de
Wildbad, il faut moins la chercher dans sa vertu cosmetique, que dans la
circonstance que je viens de signaler.”</p>

<p>It is to be remarked that it is not in all persons that the re-action
above alluded to takes place. In many there is a gradual amelioration of
health, without any perturbation of the constitution, and only marked by
an encreased action in the functions of the skin and kidneys—sometimes
of the bowels.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, says Professor Heim, where the malady is obstinate,
there is a greater struggle in the constitution, attended with considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
fever, disorder of the secretions, irritation of the nervous system,
full pulse, restless nights, distressing dreams, loss of appetite, dry hot skin,
occasional hæmorrhoidal discharges, purging, gouty attacks, cutaneous
eruptions, &amp;c. which precede a restoration of health.”</p>

<p>These are trials which require the fortitude of the patient, and the vigilance
of the physician. It is not to be wondered at that, when they
occur in the stranger, and especially in the English invalid, who has little
confidence in the foreign practitioner, and finds himself ill in a secluded
valley like that of Wildbad, great alarm should be produced, and much
prejudice raised against the baths and waters of the place. The worst of
it is, that a similar train of disorders may arise from an injudicious use of
the baths, and where no salutary crisis is the result.</p>

<div class="verse">Du secours, qu’on lui donne!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These are circumstances which ought to be pointed out to our countrymen
and women, who are too often led to distant mineral waters
and baths by flowery descriptions and miraculous cures, without any
warning as to the consequences that may ensue—whether salutary or
dangerous. The concealment of this spa or bath fever, is any thing but
beneficial either to the waters or the water-drinkers. It deceives the one,
and injures the reputation of the other. The local physicians of these
mineral springs never omit to point out the consequences of bathing in,
and drinking the waters, as I have already shewn by several quotations;
and it is highly desirable that all spa-goers should be aware of them.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Cutaneous eruptions are frequent consequences of the Wildbad waters,
and are considered salutary. The kidneys, next to the skin, shew the
greatest sensibility to the action of these waters. In some people (especially
where the waters are drunk as well as bathed in,) a most copious
and clear secretion is produced; but this is seldom a critical or salutary
discharge. It is when the secretion from the kidneys is deep-coloured,
sedimentous, and exhaling a peculiar odour, especially in gouty subjects,
that benefit may be confidently anticipated. The bowels are seldom acted
on by these waters—more frequently, indeed, constipation is the result,
requiring aperient medicine both before and during the course. The
hæmorrhoidal and monthly periods are promoted by the waters, thus
relieving plethoric fulness of the abdominal organs.</p>

difficult and premature accouchments, the waters of Wildbad are strongly
recommended.”</p>

<p>Professor Heim warns the patient not to be discouraged, even if he
leaves the waters unrelieved, or worse than when he commenced the
course. The cure will often follow, when the individual has regained his
home, weeks or months after leaving Wildbad.</p>

<p>It is only since 1836, that a source of waters for drinking has been discovered
and established at Wildbad. The mineral ingredients do not
materially differ from those of the baths. They are now very generally
used in conjunction with the latter, and are found to be very useful auxiliaries.
They sit lightly on the stomach, and prove rather aperient than
otherwise. They increase the appetite, and promote materially the action
of the skin, kidneys, and glandular organs generally.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Disorders for which the Waters of Wildbad are chiefly used.</span></h4>

<p>Dr. Fricker has laid open to Professor Heim the records of 25 years’
observation and experience of these waters; from which, and also from
his own practice, the latter physician has, in ten chapters, classified the
maladies for which the baths and waters have been employed, detailing
numerous cases, and superadding commentaries of his own. It will be
necessary to skim lightly over the heads of these chapters, in order to
shew the properties of the Wildbad spa in its direct application to practice.</p>

<p>I. <i>Rheumatism, Gout, and their Consequences.</i>—“Our baths have always
maintained great reputation for the cure of these two classes of tormenting
maladies, arising from different causes, but presenting many traits of
character in common.” The author cautions the bather against using the
baths, where there is any acute or even subacute inflammation in the
joints, muscles, or internal organs. It is in the <i>chronic</i> and painful forms
of gout and rheumatism, together with their numerous consequences,
that the Wildbad waters will be found beneficial—indeed, according to
the authors abovementioned, almost infallibly curative. Messrs. Fricker
and Heim trace many cases of tic, vertigo, deafness, affections of the sight,
asthmatic coughs, intermissions of pulse, tracheal and bronchial affections,
&amp;c. to suppressed gout and rheumatism, as they are often removed by the
baths and waters. Fifteen cases in illustration are detailed with great
minuteness by Dr. Heim, to which the Wildbad bather may refer on the
spot.</p>

<p>II. <i>Affections of the Spinal Marrow, and its Consequences, Paralysis.</i>—Diseases
of the spinal marrow are seldom recognized in their early stages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
not indeed till symptoms of paralysis begin to shew themselves in the
limbs. This class of complaints is daily augmenting in number, as the
baths of Wildbad can testify. These waters have, says M. Heim, often
dissipated the symptoms which usually precede attacks of paralysis,
and therefore, if used early, would be more useful than when taken after
the paralysis is actually developed. But even here, it is averred that the
progress of the malady is frequently arrested, and an amelioration procured.</p>

<p>When the paralysis of the lower extremities is complete—when the individual
is no longer able to walk or stand, without assistance, the waters
of Wildbad have often produced wonderful effects in restoring power—indeed
it is curious that, according to the physicians aforesaid, these baths
are frequently more successful in these cases than in those which are not
so far advanced towards a complete paralysis. An immense number of
cases are detailed by Dr. Heim under this head; and I am tempted to extract
one, which is the case of a countryman of our own.</p>

<p>“A young English gentleman, after bathing in a river, the water of
which was very cold, became completely paralytic of the lower extremities.
He came to Wildbad, and, without consulting any physician, commenced
the warmest of the baths. At the end of a fortnight he found
himself so considerably improved, that he was able to lay aside his crutches,
and walk by the aid of a cane. At this time the coronation of our youthful
queen was announced, and the patient determined to assist at the
ceremony. He bore the journey well—and returned to Wildbad after a
few weeks, without any relapse. He took a second course of the baths,
and left Wildbad ultimately in a very improved condition.”</p>

<p>Those paralyses which affect one side only, are almost universally the
result of an apoplectic attack. “When these attacks have been occasioned
by suppressed hæmorrhoidal discharges—eruptions of the skin suddenly
extinguished—engorgements or obstructions of the organs of the abdomen—female
obstructions at a certain period of life—metastases of gout or
rheumatism—in such cases of hemiplegia, the Wildbad waters have proved
serviceable, and it is delightful to see so many of these paralytics leave
Wildbad every season, with firm steps, although confined for years previously
to the couch, or crutches.”</p>

<p>Professor Heim wisely cautions those who have been of a plethoric constitution,
from too free an use of the baths, till they have ascertained how
they agree with their constitutions. Before any amelioration takes place,
the patient generally experiences some pricking pains and tinglings in the
paralyzed parts, followed by a sense of heat, perspiration, and increase of
feeling. To these symptoms succeed a gradual restoration of muscular
power, accompanied by a sense of electrical sparks passing along the
nerves. Numerous cases of paralysis of one side are detailed by Dr.
Heim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>III. and IV. These chapters are dedicated to paralysis occasioned by
poisons—and also to cases of local paralyses of particular nerves—as those
of the face. I must pass them over. The waters appear to have been
useful in many of these instances.</p>

<p>The 5th Chapter relates to affections of the joints—to lumbago—sciatica—white
swellings of the knee—contractions, &amp;c., in which the baths
of Wildbad are lauded. One caution, however, is invariably enjoined—not
to use the waters while there is any inflammation actually existing.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Sixth Chapter</span> is on diseases of the bones, with numerous cases,
which I shall pass over.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventh Chapter</span> treats of diseases of the skin, cured or relieved
by the Wildbad baths and waters. Herpes—ringworm—prurigo—pityriasis—acne—inveterate
itch—fetid perspirations, &amp;c. &amp;c. are said to be
those which receive most advantage from these waters. Indeed I think
it probable that the eulogiums are not much exaggerated as to this class
of complaints.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. VIII.</span> relates to scrofula and glandular affections generally. In
such complaints it is of the greatest consequence to conjoin the internal
with the external use of the waters of Wildbad. These waters are much
employed by people with goitre, and Drs. Fricker and Heim consider them
very beneficial in enlargements of the liver, spleen, and even of the mesenteric
glands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. IX.</span> Wildbad appears to have attained some considerable reputation
in female complaints. Next indeed in number to the class of lame
and paralytic patients, which I saw around the baths and waters of this
place, were the chlorotic females, whose countenances exhibited the
“green and yellow melancholy” of Shakespeare’s “love-sick” maiden—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent8">——“She never told her love,</div>
<div class="verse">But let concealment, like a worm i’th’bud,</div>
<div class="verse">Feed on her damask cheek.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There are more ailments than love-sickness, however, which cause the
youthful maid to “pine in thought,” and exchange all her lillies for the
pallid rose—the sparkling expression for the lack-lustre eye—and the
elasticity of youth for the languor of premature old age. For the irregularities
and obstructions that generally lead to this chlorotic state, the
baths and waters of Wildbad are strongly recommended. Dr. Heim avers
that, of late years, he has only failed in one instance to bring these
females to a state of regularity and health—where no organic disease existed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Although this is rather a startling assertion, yet the concourse of
female invalids to this place, bearing such unequivocal marks of a particular
class of ailments, offers a fair presumption that many receive benefit
there, else the numbers would diminish instead of increasing from year to
year. I can also easily believe that a course of these baths, with the daily
ingurgitation of large potions of a simple diluent water, may remove many
obstructions, and, at all events, bring the constitution into that condition
in which some good chalybeate, as Schwalbach, Spa, or Brockenau, might
exert a powerful influence on the restoration of health.</p>

<p>The new spring for drinking is at a temperature of 92°, and contains
four grains of saline substances in the pint, of which two are muriate of
soda or common salt. It is used like other thermal waters, and is slightly
aperient, but chiefly alterative.</p>

<p>The public walks to the southward of the town, extend nearly a mile
along the noisy Enz, and are very pleasant. A contemplative philosopher
might there indulge his sublime speculations—the poet his “wayward
fancies”—and the devotee his celestial meditations, with little interruption.</p>

<p>The counter-indications, or disorders not benefited, but aggravated by
the waters of Wildbad, are not materially different from those mentioned
under the head of other thermal springs—as plethora, or fulness—tendency
to apoplexy, to hæmorrhage of any kind, or to engorgements or inflammations
of any of the internal organs. Neither are they proper in cases of
considerable debility. They are not to be used in inveterate catarrhal
affections of the kidneys or bladder, attended with wasting of strength,
and probably with organic disease—in chronic diarrhœa—diabetes—internal
suppurations—confirmed phthisis—indurations of spleen or liver in an
advanced stage—dropsies—scirrhus and cancer—biliary and urinary calculi—organic
diseases of the heart—varicose veins—hypochondriasis and
hysteria, with debility—original or idiopathic epilepsy, chorea, catalepsy
and other convulsive affections of this nature—sterility dependent on organic
disease of the reproductive viscera—alienation of mind, &amp;c. On no
account should women in a state of pregnancy use the baths or waters of
Wildbad.</p>

<p>I have now presented the reader with all the information which I could
collect on the spot, from the conversations and writings of those best acquainted
with the nature and properties of the waters. Most of the
English spa-goers will be disappointed in the magic effects of the baths,
as somewhat highly-coloured by Dr. Granville—and will consider the
locality as too sombre; while the appearance of the bathers and drinkers—being
veritable invalids—many of them on crutches, and many apparently
on their way to the grave—will prove anything but cheering to the
British hypochondriac, and the sensitive nervous female. A considerable
number of English leave Wildbad in a day or two after arriving there—and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
of the few who take the waters, the majority become alarmed at the
spa-fever or irritation, abandoning the waters at the very time they are
likely to prove serviceable.</p>

<p>To those, however, who prefer quietude to fashionable frivolity—and a
secluded glen to a dashing, gambling Kursaal, the baths and waters may
prove serviceable in many of the complaints above enumerated. I would
advise all who sojourn at Baden-Baden, or who pass near Wildbad, to
visit this place, were it only for curiosity, and the singular scenery of its
neighbourhood. The journey from Baden-Baden is an easy one of a single
day—but that day should be a fine one, else all the pleasures of the excursion
will be lost. In fine, I can conscientiously aver that, in respect
to Wildbad, I have neither exaggerated its merits—</p>

<h4>SCHAFFHAUSE.</h4>

<p>Winding through the sombre solitudes of the Black Forest, we enter
the <i>Vallée d’Enfer</i>, through the narrow and frowning pass, where <span class="smcap">Moreau</span>
stemmed the torrent of the Austrian legions, as did Leonidas the myriads
of Xerxes in the Straits of Thermopylæ. Little did that able but unfortunate
general dream, during his memorable retreat through the Black
Forest, that, a few years afterwards, he would meet his death from
the mouth of a French cannon, while combatting in the ranks of the
Allies.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>What a curse would <i>foreknowledge</i> prove to man, although so ardently
desired by curious and eager mortals! A single glance through the telescope
of futurity would render us miserable for life! If good was in store,
we would relinquish all efforts to obtain it, as being certain. Every day
would seem an age till the happiness arrived—and when it came, all
relish for it would be gone. On the other hand, if the glass showed misfortune,
sickness, and sorrow in the distance—the prospect would soon
drive the wretch insane!</p>

<h3 id="RHINEFALLS">RHINEFALLS.</h3>

<p>I have always experienced some degree of disappointment at the sight
of waterfalls. Where the volume of water is great, the fall is, comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
trifling—and where the descent is from a great height, then the
stream is insignificant. If the <span class="smcap">Niagara</span> could be translated to the Staubach,
and the mighty St. Lawrence thundered from a height of eight
hundred feet into the valley of Lauterbrunnen, the scene would be awfully
grand, and sufficient to startle the Jaungfrau on her icy throne.</p>

<p>The Rhine, at Schaffhause, falls about seventy or eighty feet, and
is by no means impressive, even when viewed from the camera obscura
directly opposite the cataract. We drove from the town on a beautiful
moonlight night, and descending the stairs on the left bank of the river,
we came close to the water’s edge, and also to that of the fall itself.
Here is the spot to see and hear the deluge of water, all sparkling with
foam, in the mild light of the moon, come thundering from aloft, and
threatening every instant to overwhelm the spectator in the boiling flood.
If terror be a source of the sublime, there certainly is some degree of this
emotion, mixed with the contemplation of a vast mass of water rolling down
from a great height, apparently in a direct course towards us. The roar
of the cataract, too, is unlike that of any other sound, and adds considerably
to the effect produced on the sense of sight.</p>

<p>I do not know how the association of ideas first commenced, but I
never see a great waterfall, or a rapid river, without their suggesting
themselves as emblems of time or eternity. The torrent rolling along
in the same course through countless ages—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“In omne volubilis ævum”—</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">without change or rest, is calculated to excite reflections on the great
stream of time itself—and that inconceivable abyss—eternity—to which
it leads. But all things move in circles. The water that runs in the
river, must <i>first</i> fall from the clouds—and the rains that descend from the
air, must <i>first</i> rise from the earth. And so, perhaps, time and eternity
may be but parts of one vast, immeasurable, and incomprehensible cycle,
without beginning, middle, or end!</p>

<p>It is probable that, ere many centuries roll away, the falls of the Rhine
will become merely a rapid. The stream has worn down four or five
channels in the rocky barrier, leaving three or four fragments, resembling
the broken arches or piers of a natural bridge, standing up many feet
above the surface of the water where it begins to curl over the precipice.
The centre fragment is much higher than its brethren, and it is surmounted
by a wooden shield, (how they managed to place it there is not
easily imagined,) with the arms and motto of Schaffhause.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Deus spes</div>
<div class="verse">Nostra es.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The torrent, thus split into four or five divisions, has given rise to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
extravagant comparisons, one of which is their similitude to five foaming
white steeds, that have broke away from their keepers.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The next best place to that which I have mentioned, for viewing the
falls, is in a boat, brought as close as prudence will permit to the boiling
eddies. In a camera obscura opposite the falls, is a reflected picture of
the cataract—but I cannot imagine why it should be preferable to the
real object before our eyes.</p>

<p>There is a “German Switzerland” on the banks of the Elbe—and so
is there a “Swiss Germany” on the banks of the Rhine. From Schaffhause
to Constance, Zurich, Berne, and even Geneva, the country is
pretty and well cultivated; but it is not <span class="smcap">Switzerland</span> till we get past the
above points, and penetrate among the mountains. For the same reason
that we should ascend the Rhine from Holland, we ought to enter Switzerland
from the North, so that the grandeur and majesty of the scenery
may be always on the increase till we ascend the Splugen, the St. Gothard,
the Simplon, the St. Bernard, or the Mount Cenis.</p>

<p>Pursuing our route to the next <span class="smcap">Spa</span> on the list of this tour, we come to
Zurich.</p>

<p>Zurich, like Geneva, is situated between a placid lake and a crystal
river. Lake Leman, having filtered its waters, discharges them through
the “blue and arrowy Rhone,” into the tideless Mediterranean, not to
pass on to the vast Atlantic, but again to rise in exhalations to the clouds,
and fall—Heaven knows where. The lake of Zurich has a different taste.
It sends its purified waters through the Limmatt, to mingle with the
Rhine, (also freed from impurities in the lake of Constance,) and thence
to find its way to the great Northern Ocean—probably to visit the
Thames, the Ohio, or even the Ganges, before it makes another aerial
voyage to the skies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>The scenery about Zurich is tame and insipid, compared with that about
Geneva, where the Jura and the high Alps in the distance, contrast with
the lovely Pais de Vaud in the vicinity of the lake.</p>

<h4>LAKE OF WALLENSTADT.</h4>

<p>This lake, which is only a good day’s journey from Zurich, presents, in
my opinion, the finest lake-scenery in Switzerland. The mountains, on
the northern shore, rise almost perpendicularly to the height of five or six
thousand feet, sprinkled with ledges of rock, on which are perched the
shepherd’s chalet, and giving footing and scanty nutriment to the pine and
alpine shrubs and flowers. The mountains on the southern side are equally
high, but not so perpendicular in their descent to the lake; but the whole
circle of scenery is most magnificent. The transit of the lake is east and
west, a distance of some twelve or thirteen miles, and the passage is
usually favoured by a kind of trade wind, which blows from the westward
during one part of the day, and from the eastward during the other. The
little village of <span class="smcap">Wesen</span>, is the point of embarkation from the Zurich side,
and is situated most romantically under stupendous mountains. We
started at two o’clock, with carriage, horses, and live lumber, in the passage-boat,
which did not convey much idea of safety, being low, flat, and
rigged with a tall frail mast and square sail. The dangers of the Wallenstadt
navigation are, no doubt exaggerated; but it is evident that, along
the whole of the northern board of the lake there is but one small spot
where a boat could put in for safety in a storm. Along this shore we
sailed with a fine breeze, and enjoyed the prospect of one of the finest
scenes in Switzerland. The mountains on the northern board are so high
and precipitous, that I think it is physically impossible for a gale of wind
to blow direct on the shore, when a boat comes close to the rocks. It could
only be by the impulse of the waves that a boat might be forced amongst
the breakers. Accidents, however, very seldom happen. The afternoon
was clear sunshine—the boatmen abandoned the oars, being wafted along
by a fine breeze—the song was commenced—and the <span class="smcap">Ranz de Vache</span>
was returned from the ledges of rock, and patches of vegetation among
the cliffs, by many a blithsome shepherd, tending his flocks, or collecting
his little autumnal harvest—the long and slender cataracts poured in
sheets of gauze along many a craggy precipice—and the whole scene was
kept as a moving panorama by the steady progression of the boat.</p>

<p>In the enjoyment of Swiss or Alpine scenery, everything depends on
the state of the atmosphere, and on that of our health and spirits at the
time. Hence it is that one person is delighted with a prospect, which
another passes without pleasure or surprize at all. Of this I am certain,
that a good view of this lake’s scenery can never be erased from the
memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>We landed at the little town of Wallenstadt, situated near the lake, in
a marshy and malarious locality, often inundated by the floods, and very
insalubrious. No traveller should sleep here, as the distance to <span class="smcap">Sargans</span>
is only eight or nine miles.</p>

<p>We slept at this rook’s nest, perched on an eminence above malarious
and alluvial marshes, and at the foot of a high and craggy mount, from
the summit of which there is a superb prospect of the Rhine on its way to
Constance, and of a sea of Alps, of all altitudes—many of them shining
with snow and glaciers. Those who do not like to mount the Scholberg,
may still enjoy a magnificent panorama from the ruins of an old chateau
just above Sargans, and which is of very easy access. The town itself
presents better air than fare—the two inns being little better than <i>cabarets</i>,
but health and appetite compensate well for coarse viands and hard beds.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 id="BATHS_OF_PFEFFERS">BATHS OF PFEFFERS.</h3>

<p>Among the strange places into which man has penetrated in search of
treasure or health, there is probably not one on this earth, or under it,
more wonderful than the <span class="smcap">Baths of Pfeffers</span>, situated in the country of
the Grisons, a few miles distant from the Splugen road, as it leads from
Wallenstadt to Coire. They are little known to, and still less frequented
by the English; for we could not learn that any of our countrymen had
visited them during the summer of 1834.</p>

<p>Having procured five small and steady horses accustomed to the locality,
a party of three ladies and two gentlemen<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> started from the little town of
Ragatz on a beautiful morning in August, and commenced a steep and
zig-zag ascent up the mountain, through a forest of majestic pines and
other trees. In a quarter of an hour, we heard the roar of a torrent, but
could see nothing of itself or even its bed. The path, however, soon approached
the verge of a dark and tremendous ravine, the sides of which
were composed of perpendicular rocks several hundred feet high, and at
the bottom of which the <span class="smcap">Tamina</span>, a rapid mountain torrent, foamed along
in its course to the valley of Sargans, there to fall into the upper Rhine.
The stream itself, however, was far beyond our view, and was only known
by its hollow and distant murmurs. The ascent, for the first three miles,
is extremely fatiguing, so that the horses were obliged to take breath every
ten minutes. The narrow path, (for it is only a kind of mule-track,) often
winded along the very brink of the precipice, on our left, yet the eye could
not penetrate to the bottom of the abyss. After more than an hour of
toilsome climbing, we emerged from the wood, and found ourselves in one
of the most picturesque and romantic spots that can well be imagined.
The road now meanders horizontally through a high, but cultivated region,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
towards, the village of Valentz, through fields, gardens, vineyards, and
meadows, studded with chaumiers and chalets, perched fantastically on
projecting ledges of rock, or sheltered from the winds by tall and verdant
pines. The prospect from Valentz, or rather from above the village, is one
of the most beautiful and splendid I have anywhere seen in Switzerland.
We are there at a sufficient distance from the horrid ravine, to contemplate
it without terror, and listen to the roaring torrent, thundering unseen,
along its rugged and precipitous bed. Beyond the ravine we see the
monastery and village of Pfeffers, perched on a high and apparently inaccessible
promontory, over which rise alpine mountains, their sides covered
with woods, their summits with snow, and their gorges glittering with
glaciers. But it is towards the East that the prospect is most magnificent
and varied. The eye ranges, with equal pleasure and astonishment, over
the valley of Sargans, through which rolls the infant Rhine, and beyond
which the majestic ranges of the Rhetian Alps, ten thousand feet high,
rise one over the other, till their summits mingle with the clouds. Among
these ranges the <span class="smcap">Scesa-plana</span>, the <span class="smcap">Angstenberg</span>, the <span class="smcap">Flesch</span>, (like a
gigantic pyramid,) and in the distance the Alps that tower round Feldkirck
are the most prominent features. During our journey to the baths, the
morning sun played on the snowy summits of the distant mountains, and
marked their forms on the blue expanse behind them, in the most distinct
outlines. But, on our return, in the afternoon, when the fleecy clouds
had assembled, in fantastic groups, along the lofty barrier, the reflexions
and refractions of the solar beams threw a splendid crown of glory round
the icy heads of the Rhetian Alps—changing that “cold sublimity” with
which the morning atmosphere had invested them, into a glow of illumination
which no pen or pencil could portray. To enjoy the widest possible
range of this matchless prospect, the tourist must climb the peaks that
overhang the village, when his eye may wander over the whole of the
Grison Alps and valleys, even to the lake of Constance.</p>

<p>From Valentz we turned abruptly down towards the ravine, at the very
bottom of which are the <span class="smcap">Baths of Pfeffers</span>. The descent is by a series
of acute and precipitous tourniquets, requiring great caution, as the horses
themselves could hardly keep on their legs, even when eased of their riders.
At length we found ourselves in the area of a vast edifice, resembling an
overgrown factory, with a thousand windows, and six or seven stories high.
It is built on a ledge of rock that lies on the left bank of the <span class="smcap">Tamina</span>
torrent, which chafes along its foundation. The precipice on the opposite
side of the Tamina, and distant about fifty paces from the mansion
or rather hospital, rises five or six hundred feet, as perpendicular as a
wall, keeping the edifice in perpetual shade, except for a few hours in the
middle of the day. The left bank of the ravine, on which the hospital
stands, is less precipitous, as it admits of a zig-zag path to and from the
Baths. The locale, altogether, of such an establishment, at the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
bottom of a frightful ravine, and for ever chafed by a roaring torrent, is
the most singularly wild and picturesque I had ever beheld; but the wonders
of Pfeffers are not yet even glanced at.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>From the western extremity of this vast asylum of invalids, a narrow
wooden bridge spans the Tamina, and by it we gain footing on a small
platform of a rock on the opposite side. Here a remarkable phenomenon
presents itself. The deep ravine, which had hitherto preserved a width
of some 150 feet, contracts, all at once, into a narrow cleft or crevasse, of
less than 20 feet, whose marble sides shoot up from the bed of the torrent,
to a height of four or five hundred feet, not merely perpendicular, but actually
inclining towards each other, so that, at their summits, they almost
touch, thus leaving a narrow fissure through which a faint glimmering of
light descends, and just serves to render objects visible within this gloomy
cavern. Out of this recess the Tamina darts in a sheet of foam, and with
a deafening noise reverberated from the rocks within and without the
crevasse. On approaching the entrance, the eye penetrates along a majestic
vista of marble walls in close approximation, and terminating in
obscurity, with a narrow waving line of sky above, and a roaring torrent
below! Along the southern wall of this sombre gorge, a fragile scaffold,
of only two planks in breadth, is seen to run, suspended—as it were—in
air, fifty feet above the torrent, and three or four hundred feet beneath the
crevice that admits air and light from Heaven into the profound abyss.
This frail and frightful foot-path is continued (will it be believed?) nearly
<i>half a mile</i> into the marble womb of the mountain! Its construction must
have been a work of great difficulty and peril; for its transit cannot be
made even by the most curious and adventurous travellers, without fear
and trembling, amounting often to a sense of shuddering and horror.
Along these two planks we crept or crawled, with faltering steps and palpitating
hearts. It has been my fortune to visit most of the wonderful
localities of this globe, but an equal to this I never beheld.</p>

<p>“Imagination, (says an intelligent traveller,) the most vivid, could not
portray the portals of Tartarus under forms more hideous than those
which Nature has displayed in this place. We enter this gorge on a
bridge of planks (pont de planches) sustained by wedges driven into the
rocks. It takes a quarter of an hour or more to traverse this bridge, and
it requires the utmost precaution. It is suspended over the Tamina,
which is heard rolling furiously at a great depth beneath. The walls of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
this cavern, twisted, torn, and split (les parois laterales contournées, fendues,
et dechirées) in various ways, rise perpendicular, and even incline
towards each other, in the form of a dome; whilst the faint light that
enters from the portal at the end, and the crevice above, diminishes as we
proceed;—the cold and humidity augmenting the horror produced by the
scene. The fragments of rock sometimes overhang this gangway in such
a manner, that the passenger cannot walk upright:—at others, the marble
wall recedes so much, that he is unable to lean against it for support.
The scaffold is narrow, often slippery; and sometimes there is but a single
plank, separating us from the black abyss of the Tamina.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> He who has
cool courage, a steady eye, and a firm step, ought to attempt this formidable
excursion (épouvantable excursion) in clear and dry weather, lest he
should find the planks wet and slippery. He should start in the middle
of the day, with a slow and measured step, and without a stick. The
safest plan is to have two guides supporting a pole, on the inside of which
the stranger is to walk.”</p>

<p>We neglected this precaution, and four out of the five pushed on, even
without a guide at all. At forty or fifty paces from the entrance the
gloom increases, while the roar of the torrent beneath, reverberated from
the sides of the cavern, augments the sense of danger and the horror of
the scene. The meridian sun penetrated sufficiently through the narrow
line of fissure at the summit of the dome, to throw a variety of lights and
of shadows over the vast masses of variegated marble composing the walls
of this stupendous cavern, compared with which, those of Salsette, Elephanta,
and even Staffa, shrink into insignificance. A wooden pipe, which
conveys the hot waters from their source to the baths, runs along in the
angle between the scaffold and the rocks, and proves very serviceable,
both as a support for one hand while pacing the plank, and as a seat,
when the passenger wishes to rest, and contemplate the wonders of the
cavern. At about one-third of the distance inward, I would advise the
tourist to halt, and survey the singular locality in which he is placed.
The inequality of breadth in the long chink that divides the dome above,
admits the light in very different proportions, and presents objects in a
variety of aspects. The first impression which occupies the mind is
caused by the cavern itself, with reflection on the portentous convulsion of
Nature which split the marble rock in twain, and opened a gigantic aqueduct
for the mountain torrent.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> After a few minutes’ rumination on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
action of subterranean fire, our attention is attracted to the slow but
powerful operation of water on the solid parietes of this infernal grotto.
We plainly perceive that the boisterous torrent has, in the course of time,
and especially when swelled by rains, caused wonderful changes both in
its bed and its banks. I would direct the attention of the traveller to a
remarkable excavation formed by the waters on the opposite side of the
chasm, and in a part more sombre than usual, in consequence of a bridge
that spans the crevice above, and leads to the Convent of Pfeffers. This
natural grotto is hollowed out of the marble rock to the depth of 30
feet, being nearly 40 feet in width, by 26 feet in height. It is difficult
not to attribute it to art; and, as the whole cavern constantly reminds us
of the Tartarean Regions, this beautifully vaulted grotto seems to be fitted
for the throne of Pluto and Proserpine—or, perhaps, for the tribunal of
Rhadamanthus and his brothers of the Bench, while passing sentence on
the ghosts that glide down this Acheron or Cocytus—for had the <span class="smcap">Tamina</span>
been known to the ancient poets, it would assuredly have been ranked as
one of the rivers of Hell.</p>

<p>One of the most startling phenomena, however, results from a perspective
view into the cavern, when about midway, or rather less, from its
portal. The rocky vista ends in obscurity; but gleams and columns of
light burst down, in many places, from the meridian sun, through this
“palpable obscure,” so as to produce a wonderful variety of light and
shade, as well as of bas-relief, along the fractured walls. While sitting
on the rude wooden conduit before alluded to, and meditating on the infernal
region upon which I had entered, I was surprised to behold, at a
great distance, the figures of human beings, or thin shadows (for I could
not tell which), advancing slowly towards me—suspended between Heaven
and earth—or, at least, between the vault of the cavern and the torrent
of the Tamina, without any apparent pathway to sustain their steps, but
seemingly treading in air, like disembodied spirits! While my attention
was rivetted on these figures, they suddenly disappeared; and the first
impression on my mind was, that they had fallen and perished in the horrible
abyss beneath. The painful sensation was soon relieved by the reappearance
of the personages in more distinct shapes, and evidently composed
of flesh and blood. Again they vanished from my sight; and, to
my no small astonishment, I beheld their ghosts or their shadows advancing
along the opposite side of the cavern! These, and many other optical
illusions, were caused, of course, by the peculiar nature of the locality,
and the unequal manner in which the light penetrated from above into this
sombre chasm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Surprise was frequently turned into a sense of danger, when the parties,
advancing and retreating, met on this narrow scaffold. The “laws of
the road” being different on the Continent from those in Old England,
my plan was to screw myself up into the smallest compass, close to the
rock, and thus allow passengers to steal by without opposition. We
found that comparatively few penetrated to the extremity of the cavern
and the source of the Thermæ—the majority being frightened, or finding
themselves incapable of bearing the sight of the rapid torrent under their
feet, without any solid security against precipitation into the infernal
gulf. To the honour of the English ladies, I must say that they explored
the source of the waters with the most undaunted courage, and without
entertaining a thought of returning from a half-finished tour to the regions
below.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Advancing still farther into the cavern, another phenomenon presented
itself, for which we were unable to account at first. Every now and then
we observed a gush of vapour or smoke (we could not tell which) issue
from the further extremity of the rock on the left, spreading itself over
the walls of the cavern, and ascending towards the crevice in the dome.
It looked like an explosion of steam; but the roar of the torrent would
have prevented us from hearing any noise, if such had occurred. We
soon found, however, that it was occasioned by the rush of vapour from
the cavern in which the thermal source is situated, every time the door
was opened for the ingress or egress of visitors to and from this natural
vapour-bath. At such moments the whole scene is so truly Tartarean,
that had Virgil and Dante been acquainted with it, they need not have
strained their imaginations in portraying the ideal abodes of fallen angels,
infernal gods, and departed spirits, but painted a <span class="smcap">Hades</span> from Nature, with
all the advantage of truth and reality in its favour.</p>

<p>Our ingress occupied nearly half an hour, when we found ourselves at
the extremity of the parapet, on a jutting ledge of rock, and where the
cavern assumed an unusually sombre complexion, in consequence of the
cliffs actually uniting, or nearly so, at the summit of the dome. Here,
too, the <span class="smcap">Tamina</span> struggled, roared, and foamed through the narrow, dark,
and rugged gorge with tremendous impetuosity and deafening noise, the
sounds being echoed and reverberated a thousand times by the fractured
angles and projections of the cavern. We were now at the source of the
<span class="smcap">Thermæ</span>. Ascending some steps cut out of the rock, we came to a door,
which opened, and instantly enveloped us in tepid steam. We entered a
grotto in the solid marble, but of what dimensions we could form no estimate,
since it was dark as midnight, and full of dense and fervid vapour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
We were quickly in an universal perspiration. The guides hurried us
forward into another grotto, still deeper in the rock, where the steam was
suffocating, and where we exuded at every pore. It was as dark as pitch.
An owl would not have been able to see an eagle within a foot of its saucer
eyes. We were told to stoop and stretch out our hands. We did so,
and immersed them in the boiling—or, at least, the gurgling, source of the
<span class="smcap">Pfeffers</span>. We even quaffed at this fountain of Hygeia.</p>

<p>Often had we slept in damp linen, while travelling through Holland,
Germany, and Switzerland. We had now, by way of variety, a waking
set of integuments saturated with moisture <i>ab interno</i>, as well as <i>ab externo</i>,
to such an extent, that I believe each of us would have weighed at
least half a stone more at our exit than on our entrance into this stew-pan
of the Grison Alps.</p>

<p>On emerging into the damp, gelid, and gloomy atmosphere of the
cavern, every thing appeared of a dazzling brightness after our short immersion
in the Cimmerian darkness of the grotto. The transition of temperature
was equally as abrupt as that of light. The vicissitude could
have been little less than 50 or 60 degrees of Fahrenheit in one instant,
with all the disadvantage of dripping garments! It was like shifting the
scene, with more than theatrical celerity, from the Black Hole of Calcutta
to Fury Beach, or the snows of Nova Zembla. Some of the party, less
experienced in the effects of travelling than myself, considered themselves
destined to illustrate the well-known allegory of the discontented—and
that they would inevitably carry away with them a large cargo of that
which thousands come here annually to get rid of—<span class="smcap">rheumatism</span>. I
confess that I was not without some misgivings myself on this point,
seeing that we had neither the means of changing our clothes nor of drying
them—except by the heat of our bodies in the mountain breeze. The
Goddess of Health, however, who is nearly related to the Genius of Travelling,
preserved us from all the bad consequences, thermometrical and
hygrometrical, of these abrupt vicissitudes.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>We retrograded along the narrow plank that suspended us over the
profound abyss with caution, fear, and astonishment. The <span class="smcap">Tamina</span> seemed
to roar more loud and savage beneath us, as if incensed at our safe retreat.
The sun had passed the meridian, and the gorge had assumed a far more
lugubrious aspect than it wore on our entrance. The shivered rocks and
splintered pinnacles that rose on each side of the torrent, in gothic arches
of altitude sublime, seemed to frown on our retreating footsteps—while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the human figures that moved at a distance along the crazy plank, before
and behind us, frequently lost their just proportions, and assumed the most
grotesque and extraordinary shapes and dimensions, according to the degree
of light admitted by the narrow fissure above, and the scarcely discernible
aperture at the extremity of this wonderful gorge. The <span class="smcap">Tamina</span>,
meanwhile, did not fail to play its part in the gorgeous scene—astonishing
the eye by the rapidity of its movements, and astounding the ear by the
vibrations of its echoes. It seemed to growl more furiously as we receded
from the depths of the crevasse.</p>

<p>At length we gained the portal, and, as the sun was still darting his
bright rays into the deepest recesses of the ravine, glancing from the
marble rocks, and glittering on the boiling torrent, the sudden transition
from Cimmerian gloom to dazzling day-light, appeared like enchantment.
While crossing the trembling bridge, I looked back on a scene which can
never be eradicated from my memory. It is the most singular and impressive
I have ever beheld on this globe, and compared with which, the
<span class="smcap">Brunnens</span> are “bubbles” indeed!<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>While examining the waters, the baths, and the internal economy of the
vast <span class="smcap">valetudinarium</span> that stands in this savage locality, the bell announced
the approach of the second, or superior dinner, which happened
that day to be rather later than usual. The <span class="smcap">Salon</span>, overlooking the
torrent of the Tamina, was soon replenished with guests of the better
order; the canaille, or swarm of inferior invalids having dined two hours
or more previously, in the common <span class="smcap">Salle a Manger</span>. It needed but
little professional discrimination to class and specify them. The majority
proclaimed the causes of their visits to the Pfeffers. Rheumatism, scrofula,
and cutaneous diseases, formed the prominent features in this motley assemblage.
Invalids, with chronic complaints, real or imaginary, such as
abound at all watering places, foreign and domestic, were mingled in the
group; while a small portion, including our own party, evinced anything
but corporeal ailments—unless a “<span class="smcap">canine appetite</span>” at a genuine German
<i>table-d’hôte</i> may be ranked among the evils to which English flesh is
heir. Some monks, from the neighbouring monastery, (to which the Baths
belong,) took rank, and indeed precedence, in this small division. The
mountain breeze and fervid sun of the Convent of Pfeffers had bronzed
them with much of that nut-brown complexion, which travelling exercise
in the open air had conferred on their British visitors; while their sleek
cheeks and portly corporations proved, almost to a demonstration, that the
holy fathers descended into the profound ravine of the Tamina to give their
benediction to the waters, rather than to drink them—and to add a sacred
zest to the viands of the <span class="smcap">Refectory</span>, by the alacrity with which they
swallowed them. Their appearance illustrated the truth of the adage—“What
will not poison will fatten.”</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Waters of Pfeffers.</span></h4>

<p>The Waters of <span class="smcap">Pfeffers</span> have neither taste, smell, nor colour. They
will keep for ten years, without depositing a sediment, or losing their transparency.
But we are not to infer that they are destitute of medicinal
powers, because they possess no sensible properties. In their chemical
composition, they have hitherto shewn but few ingredients; and those of
the simpler saline substances, common to most mineral springs.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> It does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
not follow, however, that they contain no active materials because chemistry
is not able to detect them. Powerful agents may be diffused in
waters, and which are incapable of analysis, or destructible by the process
employed for that purpose. The only sure test is <span class="smcap">experience</span> of their
effects on the human body. It is not probable that the Baths of Pfeffers
would have attracted such multitudes of invalids, annually, from Switzerland,
Germany, and Italy; and that for six centuries, if their remedial
agency had been null or imaginary.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Their visitors are not of that fashionable
class, who run to watering-places for pleasure rather than for health—or,
to dispel the vapours of the town by the pure air of the coast or the
country. Yet, as human nature is essentially the same in all ranks of
society, I have no doubt that much of the fame acquired by the Baths of
Pfeffers, has been owing to the auxiliary influence of air, locality, change
of scene, moral impressions, and the peculiar mode of using the waters.
Their temperature—100° of Fahren.—certain physical phenomena which
they evince, and the nature of the diseases which they are reported to cure,
leave little doubt in my mind that their merits, though overrated, like
those of all other mineral springs, are very considerable.</p>

<p>The disorders for which they are most celebrated, are rheumatic and
neuralgic pains, glandular swellings, and cutaneous eruptions. But they
are also resorted to by a host of invalids afflicted with those anomalous
and chronic affections, to which nosology has assigned no name, and for
which the Pharmacopœia affords very few remedies. As the Baths belong
to the neighbouring Convent of Pfeffers, and, as the holy fathers afford
not only spiritual consolation to the patients, but medical assistance in
directing the means of cure, there is every reason to believe, or, at least,
to hope, that the moral, or rather divine influence of Religion co-operates
with mere physical agency, in removing disease and restoring health.</p>

<p>The Waters of Pfeffers are led from their sombre source in the cavern,
along the narrow scaffold before described, into a series of baths scooped
out of the rocky foundation of this vast hospital, each bath capable of accommodating
a considerable number of people at the same time. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
thermal waters are constantly running into and out of the baths—or rather
through them, so that the temperature is preserved uniform, and the waters
themselves in a state of comparative purity, notwithstanding the numbers
immersed in them. The baths are arched with stone—the window to each
is small, admitting little light, and less air:—and, as the doors are kept
shut, except when the bathers are entering or retiring, the whole space not
occupied by water, is full of a dense vapour, as hot as the Thermæ themselves.
The very walls of the baths are warm, and always dripping with
moisture. Such are the <span class="smcap">Sudatoria</span> in which the German, Swiss, and
Italian invalids indulge more luxuriously than ever did the Romans in the
Baths of Caracalla. In these they lie daily, from two, to six, eight, ten—and
sometimes sixteen hours!<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The whole exterior of the body is thus
soaked, softened—parboiled; while the interior is drenched by large quantities
swallowed by the mouth—the patient, all this while, breathing the
dense vapour that hovers over the baths. The Waters of Pfeffers, therefore,
inhaled and imbibed, exhaled and absorbed, for so many hours daily,
must permeate every vessel, penetrate every gland, and percolate through
every pore of the body. So singular a process of human maceration in
one of Nature’s cauldrons, conducted with German patience and German
enthusiasm, must, I think, relax many a rigid muscle—unbend many a
contracted joint—soothe many an aching nerve—clear many an unsightly
surface—resolve many an indurated gland—open many an obstructed passage—and
restore many a suspended function. The fervid and detergent
streams of the Pfeffers, in fact, are actually turned, daily and hourly,
through the Augean stable of the human constitution, and made to rout
out a host of maladies indomitable by the prescriptions of the most sage
physicians. The fable of <span class="smcap">Medea’s</span> revival of youthful vigour in wasted
limbs is very nearly realized in the mountains of the Grisons, and in the
savage ravine of the <span class="smcap">Tamina</span>. Lepers are here purified—the lame commit
their crutches to the flames—the tumid throat and scrofulous neck are
reduced to symmetrical dimensions—and sleep revisits the victim of rheumatic
pains and neuralgic tortures.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 id="Hydropathy"><span class="smcap">Hydropathy, Hydro-sudo-pathy—or Hydrotherapeia.</span></h3>

<p>These are the titles given to a system of healing human maladies by
means of perspiration and cold water. It is making rapid progress in
Germany, that land of ideality—and the tribe of other pathys.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Homœopathy—allopathy—and even spa-pathy are in danger. Although it is no
new system, being practised for a long time by the Russians, yet it is
only about fifteen years since Priestnitz, a Silesian peasant, introduced it
amongst his native mountains, and in a shape and manner differing somewhat
from the Russian practice.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the application of cold water to the
surface of the body, whether generally or locally, is a powerful agent,
when skilfully managed. The chill that is painfully felt on the first
plunge—the recoil of the circulation from the surface to the great central
organs and vessels—the shrinking of all external parts—the rapid abstraction
of animal heat—the hurried respiration—and last and most
important of all—the reaction which follows the bath—are all important
phenomena, that may work much good or evil in the animal economy,
according as they are watched and regulated. The reaction after the cold
bath is not less curious than the recoil. The heart and great internal
organs seem overwhelmed and stunned, for a time, by the first shock.
But soon after emerging from the bath, they begin to recover energy, and
to free themselves from the volume of congested blood, under which they
laboured. They then drive the circulation to the surface with increasing
force, filling and distending the vessels of the skin beyond the normal or
medium condition. With this distension comes a glow of heat all over
the body, and a feeling of elasticity, or bien-être, which it is difficult to
describe. A third series of phenomena now commence. All the glandular
organs of the body now take on an augmented degree of activity,
and their secretions become more copious than before the bath. Contemporary
with this increase of secretion internally, the skin itself acts more
vigorously, and not only the insensible, but the sensible perspiration becomes
more copious. In fact, the cold bath gives rise to a series, or rather
three series of phenomena, very closely resembling a paroxysm of ague—viz.
the cold, hot, and sweating stages. After a few hours all the functions
return to their normal or usual routine of duty.</p>

<p>But things do not always run thus smoothly. If any particular internal
organ be much disordered in function, or at all changed in structure, it is
very apt to be so overpowered by the recoil or first shock of the cold bath,
that when reaction comes on, it is only partial and imperfect, in consequence
of the weak organ or organs remaining in a state of congestion,
and incapable of freeing themselves from the overplus of blood determined
upon them by the retreat of the circulation from the surface.
Then we have headache, lassitude, drowsiness, general malaise, or local
uneasiness, imperfect reaction, scanty or disordered secretions, with many
other uncomfortable feelings, instead of that elasticity and buoyancy which
have been already noticed.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further on the cold bath, let us glance at the
peculiar manner in which it is employed by the hydro-therapeutic doctors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of Germany, who have now establishments in many of the principal
towns.</p>

<p>About four or five o’clock in the morning, the patient is wrapped up to
the chin (while in bed) in a thick woollen shirt. Outside of this is placed
another covering of down, fur, or any warm and impermeable material.
In a short time the disengagement of animal heat from the body thus
enveloped, forms a fervid atmosphere around him, which soon induces a
copious perspiration, in the greater number of individuals. It has been
observed that, in diseased parts, as for instance, in the joints of gouty
people, the perspiration was longest in breaking out. When the skin is
obstinate, friction and other means are used to accelerate the cutaneous
discharge. When the physician judges that the perspiration has been
sufficient, the patient is quickly disrobed and plunged into a cold bath,
which is kept ready at the side of his bed. The first shock is very unpleasant;
but that over, the invalid feels very comfortable, and when the
process is likely to prove favourable, there is frequently observed on the
surface of the water a kind of viscid scum, the supposed morbid matter
thrown off from the body. The period of immersion in the cold bath is
carefully watched, for if protracted too long it proves hurtful, or even
dangerous. Some people will not bear the cold immersion above a minute—others
are allowed to remain till the approach of a second shiver.
Where the patient is very delicate or weak, the temperature of the bath is
raised a little. In other cases, the bath is artificially depressed below the
natural temperature of the water.</p>

<p>On emerging from the bath, the patient is quickly dressed, and immediately
commences exercise, and drinks abundantly of cold water. The
limit to this ingurgitation is sense of pain or weight in the stomach.
The patient, although rather averse to the cold drink at first, soon becomes
fond of it, and will swallow fifteen or twenty goblets with a keen
relish. After the promenade and cold drink is over, a nourishing breakfast
is taken. All stimulating or exciting beverages are entirely prohibited.
The appetite generally becomes keen, and the digestion, even of
dyspeptics, strong and effective during this course. Between breakfast
and dinner is variously employed, according to the strength of the patients
or the nature of the disease. Some take riding or pedestrian exercise—others
gymnastics—and a few have more cold water, as a plunging or
shower bath.</p>

<p>The dinner is to be light, and soon after mid-day. It is generally taken
with a keen appetite. During the three or four hours after dinner, all exercise
of mind or body is forbidden, but sleep is not to be indulged in.
Towards evening, some of the stronger patients repeat the same process
which they underwent in the morning; but those who are weak, or in whom
the crisis is approaching, only take cold water to drink in moderation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
After a slight supper the patient retires to sleep, in order that he may early
resume the routine of the water-cure.</p>

<p>The professors of this system vary the mode of application almost infinitely—especially
the external application of the cold water, according to
the general or local seat of the complaint. They act very much on the
doctrine of revulsion or derivation. Thus when there are symptoms of
fulness or congestion about the head or the chest, a half-bath or hip-bath
of cold water is employed, disregarding the first impression of cold on the
lower parts of the body, but looking to the <i>reaction</i> which is to take place
there, and to the consequent derivation of blood from the head and chest.
Foot-baths, cold lotions, fomentations, and poultices are variously used,
according to the nature or seat of the malady.</p>

<p>Like the spa waters, this <span class="smcap">hydrotherapeia</span> produces, in a great many
instances, a <span class="smcap">crisis</span>. For some days the patients feel themselves much
more energetic and comfortable than before the course was begun; but
after a time “a veritable state of fever is produced, the result of this
general effervescence.”<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Then the symptoms of the complaint, whatever
it may be, are all exasperated and acquire an increase of intensity—even old
diseases, that were forgotten, will sometimes re-appear—but all this commotion
is the precursor of a salutary crisis and a return to health. A kind
of prickly heat, with itching of the skin, is a common occurrence in the
course of the cure. “The effects produced even on organic diseases by
this hydro-therapeutic treatment would convince the most sceptical of its
wonderful efficacy.”—<i>Engel.</i></p>

<p>The diseases to which this remedy is now applied in Germany are numerous
and very different. Fevers, even of the most inflammatory kind, are
said to yield to it. Pure inflammations of vital organs are fearlessly submitted
to it. The first case related by Dr. Engel, is one of pneumonia,
well marked, in a young girl who had been exposed to a current of cold
air after violent exercise in the heat of the day. Dr. Weiss ordered her
to be enveloped in a blanket, wet with cold water, and then other blankets
over the wet one, with plenty of cold water to drink. Some amelioration
of the symptoms followed; but in two hours they were again intense.
Two foreign physicians accompanied Dr. E. to the bed-side of the patient,
and prognosticated a fatal termination unless she were bled, and the cold
water treatment declined. Dr. E. with the greatest confidence, ordered
the blanket to be again wetted with cold water. This second application
was followed by increase of the burning heat, and also by delirium. Notwithstanding
the remonstrances of the foreigners, Dr. E. was still firm in
his purpose—and ordered the wet blankets to be applied every half-hour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
No change took place till after the sixth application, when the kidneys
acted copiously. The seventh application was followed by diminution of
the thirst and heat—the patient became more tranquil—began to perspire—and
fell into a short sleep. The perspiration continued copious for
twenty-two hours, and was kept up by the drinking of large quantities of
cold water. The perspiration having ceased, the patient was put into a
cold half-bath (slipper) where the respiration became more free. On being
taken out and covered over she perspired copiously. The wet blankets
were now applied only twice a day, with an occasional half-bath. On the
fifth day she was well. (Weiss.)</p>

<p>Before proceeding farther, it will be proper to explain that the transition
from a hot bath to a cold one, even in a state of perspiration, is not half so
dangerous as most people imagine. It is well known that if we jump out
of hot water into cold, we resist the shock, and bear the effects of the
latter better than if we took the plunge without any preparation. But
then there is a strong prejudice that <i>perspiration</i> is an insuperable bar to
the application of cold water to the surface. If the individual has come
into a state of perspiration from bodily exercise, and especially if he be
fatigued or exhausted—then the cold water would be dangerous. But this
is not the case, to any extent, when he is warmed either by the hot bath,
or by the accumulation of heat generated in his own body. This is proved
by authentic facts which have come under my own observation. Forty
years ago, when the Russian troops were encamped in the islands of
Guernsey and Jersey, the soldiers constructed rude stone huts or ovens
along the beech, for vapour baths. Into these they put stones, and heated
them by fire, when they poured water over them, and thus filled the hut
with a dense vapour. When the men had continued in this rude vapour-bath
till they were in a state of perspiration, they leaped into the sea, and
swam about till they were tired. All this was done, partly for health, partly
for pleasure. It is well-known to all northern travellers that the Russians
are in the habit of steaming themselves in the vapour-baths, and then
directly rolling themselves in the snow. Every one, too, must have observed
postillions dashing their foaming and perspiring horses into any convenient
water at the end of their journey, without the least fear of their animals
being injured by the dip.</p>

<p>Here then is a complete counter-part, or rather prototype of the <span class="smcap">hydro-sudo-pathy</span>,
as already described. But there is one process which will
appear incredible to most people—that of procuring perspiration by means
of blankets wetted with cold water. Let us see whether an illustration of
this may not be found. Every one who has read the Waverly Novels must
have been struck with the singular practice pursued by some Highlanders
(outlaws I think) who were obliged to pass many winter nights unsheltered
on the freezing mountains. When they were desirous of sleeping, they
dipped their plaids in the freezing water of the nearest pool or stream,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and, wrapping themselves in this dripping and gelid mantle, went quietly
to sleep! So long as the plaid kept wet, the Highlander kept warm, and
slept soundly; but the moment it got dry, the man was awoke by the
cold, and proceeded to the brook or stream to saturate his bed-clothes
again with cold water. Here we have the prototype of the German process
described in the case of the girl with inflamed lungs. By what process
of <i>reasoning</i> the Silesian peasant and the Celtic mountaineer, arrived
at the knowledge of these curious facts, would be difficult to imagine.
There was probably no reasoning in either case, but chance, observation,
and experience.</p>

<p>It is sometimes more easy to explain a phenomenon when discovered,
than to arrive at it by any process of reasoning previously. The wet plaid
by confining the animal heat of the Highlander, soon occasioned a warm
atmosphere around his body, which kept him comfortable. But as soon
as the plaid got dry and its texture <i>pervious</i>, then the animal heat rapidly
escaped, and the feeling of cold dispelled sleep. In the case of pneumonia
related by Dr. Weiss, the wet blanket was surmounted by several other
blankets, which effectually prevented the escape of animal heat, which
would soon accumulate and eventuate in perspiration. In such cases there
would be a chill at first, succeeded by reaction, heat, and transpiration.
We see this exemplified every day, where cold lotions are applied to an
inflamed part. If the clothes are defended from the external air, they
soon become warm, and form a fomentation—whereas, if exposed to a
current of air, they will almost freeze the part by evaporation. Dr.
Weiss’s patient would never have perspired, if the wet blanket had not
been covered by dry ones.</p>

<p>We are now prepared to glance at some other cases recorded by the
professors of hydropathy.</p>

<p>Dr. Engin relates the following cases of catarrhal and rheumatic fever.
A delicate female, aged 30 years, was taken ill on the 27th of April 1837,
with the abovementioned complaint, but was under an allopathic doctor
till the 30th, when Dr. E. found her labouring under acute pains in the
joints—inflamed throat—difficulty of swallowing—joints swelled and red—inability
to move—pulse 100. The patient was enveloped in a cold wet
blanket, over which several dry ones were placed, twice a day, for three
days consecutively. She soon began to perspire copiously each time of
application. On the fourth day she was plunged into a cold bath while
deluged with sweat. This was repeated twelve days in succession, the
inflamed joints being kept, in the intervals, covered with cold wetted
cloths. During all this time she was ordered to drink plenty of cold
water. The fever and all the other symptoms gradually diminished, and
finally disappeared. Towards the end of the treatment a critical eruption
appeared on the skin.</p>

<p>This was certainly as unfavourable a case for the hydropathic treatment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
as could well be imagined; and the fact of its being put in practice, even
with impunity, may afford matter for reflection.</p>

<p>Cases are detailed by Dr. Engin and others, where scarlatina, erysipelas,
herpes, and other cutaneous eruptions, were treated on hydropathic
principles, and seemingly with success. Hæmorrhages of various kinds,
from nose, lungs, bowels, &amp;c. are subjected to this treatment, as well as a
host of chronic maladies, including constipation, hæmorrhoids, amenorrhœa,
chlorosis, liver complaints, jaundice, gout, rheumatism, melancholia,
hypochondriasis, hysteria, epilepsy, tic douloureux, gastrodynia, scrofula,
rickets, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Now, although I should be far from recommending this practice in many
of the complaints where it has been employed, yet, as the institutions for
the hydropathic treatment are now spread all over Germany, and open to
the inspection of all medical men, (unlike the hocus-pocus fraud, mystery,
and deception of homœopathy,) it would be unwise not to examine into a
system which shocks our prejudices rather than runs counter to historical
facts and philosophical reasoning.</p>

<p>At all events, this system corroborates a practice which I have now
followed and publicly recommended for many years; namely, the “<span class="smcap">Calido-frigid
Sponging</span>, or <span class="smcap">Lavation</span>.” This consists in sponging the
face, throat, and upper part of the chest, night and morning, with <i>hot</i>
water, and then immediately with <i>cold</i> water. I have also recommended
that children should be habituated to this sponging all over the body, as
the means of inuring them to, and securing them from, the injuries produced
by atmospheric vicissitudes. It is the best preservative which I
know against face-aches, tooth-aches, (hot and cold water being alternately
used to rinse the mouth,) ear-aches, catarrhs, &amp;c. so frequent and distressing
in this country. But its paramount virtue is that of preserving
many a constitution from pulmonary consumption, the causes of which
are often laid in repeated colds, and in the susceptibility to atmospheric
impressions.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<h4>CHEMIN DE MER—CHEMIN DE FER.</h4>

<p>A short run of fourteen hours from the Tower, on a road as smooth as
that of the Great Western Railway, deposited us safely at Ostende—a kind
of flat and fortified Gravesend, where John Bull, as far as tongue and
table are concerned, is as much at home as if he were in Deptford or
Greenwich. At six in the morning, every thing is bustle among the baggage,
and it requires half a dozen omnibuses to convey travellers, trunks,
clothes-bags and band-boxes from the hotels to the station. And here I
would advise every passenger to mark the <i>destination</i> on every package,
and take care of the receipt ticket, otherwise he may find, on his arrival
at Brussels, Liege, or Antwerp, that his luggage has travelled to quite a
different quarter, requiring a “reclamation” to be sent along the lines, and
perhaps two or three days’ delay! One of my trunks, and that too,
the one containing the “sinews of war,” was “absent without leave,”
when I reached Brussels, and was afterwards found lying in the office at
Ghent!</p>

<p>Short as was our passage to the Station by the <span class="smcap">omnibus</span>, it gave rise
to a warm discussion respecting this very convenient and economical
vehicle, which was considered by one of the party as a great recent improvement
on hackneys, cabs, and stage-coaches. An Irish Tutor, however,
who was one of the company, maintained that the <span class="smcap">omnibus</span> was in
common use more than two thousand years ago, in every country between
the banks of the Ganges and the pillars of Hercules. This was so startling
an assertion that the gentleman was called on for proof. “That I
will give,” said he, “from the tenth Satire of Juvenal, which commences
thus:”—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“OMNIBUS in terris quæ sunt à gadibus usque</div>
<div class="verse">Auroram et gangem.”——</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The cockneys stared at each other, and one or two gentlemen laughed
most immoderately. The <span class="smcap">Domine</span> proceeded to translate the passage for
the benefit of the ladies, and others who might not possess a knowledge
of the dead languages.</p>

<p>“<i>Omnibus in terris</i>” there are OMNIBUSES in all countries, “<i>quæ
sunt</i>,” that lie, “<i>a gadibus</i>,” between Cadiz, “<i>auroram et gangem</i>” and the
banks of the Ganges.</p>

<p>This ingenious distortion of the celebrated passage in Juvenal, was delivered
with such assumed gravity and apparent honesty, that it carried
conviction to nine-tenths of the passengers, and those few who detected
the sophistry, were so much pleased with the joke, that they applauded
the learning of the Theban. Nor would it have been very easy to prove
that he was <i>literally</i> wrong. “<span class="smcap">Omnibus</span>” was in use wherever the latin
language prevailed; and though not specifically designed as a vehicle for
<i>passengers and luggage</i>, it was employed to carry <i>all kinds of things</i>—hence
the application of it to the modern and very useful Noah’s Ark on four
wheels.</p>

<p>A good deal of scepticism has been expressed respecting the “flying
Dutchman” of the novelist and others. But I do not see why we should
not have a “flying Dutchman,” seeing that we have “flying Belgians.”
If, in the good old times of Marlbro’, Napoleon, and Wellington, a train
of artillery moving at the rate of ten or twelve miles an hour, was called
a <i>“flying” train</i>, surely a train going at the rate of twenty-five or thirty
miles an hour, and carrying a small army with its baggage on its back,
deserves the epithet of a “<i>flying train</i>.” Never was country better calculated
for rail-roads than a great portion of Holland and Belgium. You
have only to lay down sleepers and rails in any direction, and all is ready
for the engine. Nor is there any extra expence required for guarding man
or beast against accidents. The train brushes along the sides or gable of
a cottage—dashes through the centre of a village—plunges through the
suburbs of a city—skips over a public road without disturbing a stone of
the pavé—darts over a canal—and all with scarcely a rail or fence to
prevent intrusion on the lines. The Belgians are either very cautious, or
very reckless of life. You will see men, women, and children standing or
sitting within six feet of the trains; but no accident seems ever to occur.
As for cattle straying on the rail-roads, there is little danger of that; for
you may travel from Ostende to Liege, without seeing ox or ass, cow or
calf, sheep or goat—or anything with four legs—except in the towns. All
is corn, hay, potatoes, and clover—or clover, potatoes, hay and corn—or
some combination of these four staple articles.</p>

<p>But neither rail-roads nor love are found to run always smooth. As we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
approach Liege the ground becomes so rugged, and the hills so steep, that
tunnels of prodigious length and depth are necessary to complete the line
to Liege, Aix, and Cologne. It is said the Americans contemplate a perforation
of the Allighany Mountains, in order that rail-roads may be extended
to Kentucky. The task will not be much less difficult to connect
Ostende with the Rhine. But the persevering industry of Germans—the
“improbus labor”—will conquer all obstructions.</p>

<h4>ANTWERP ROUTE.</h4>

<p>While the train is flying along between Brussels and Liege, let us glance
at the Antwerp route. It is generally preferred to that of Ostende—though
for what good reason I am ignorant. The land is surely more
natural to man than the water. True the difference between the two
routes consists chiefly in the length of the river voyage; but, of all the
navigations which I have ever experienced round this globe, the “<span class="smcap">Navigation
of the Scheldt</span>,” is amongst the most insipid and monotonous.
To me, too, it recalled scenes the most triste, and reminiscences the most
dolorous. The very lapse of time itself (31 years) since I first anathematized
its malodorous and malarious banks, is not a very pleasing retrospect.
But the recollection of what passed there in 1809, can never be
called up without pain and mortification!</p>

<p>While the steamer was ploughing her weary way between Flushing and
Cadsand, <span class="smcap">Memory</span>, that mysterious power, quickly reproduced the drama,
on which the curtain had fallen for more than thirty years! The hundred
pendants floating in the air—the masses of troops, whose polished arms
gleamed in the sun—the frowning and hostile ramparts and batteries on
each side of the pass covered with thousands of soldiers and citizens—the
daring rush of three men-of-war (in one of which, the <span class="smcap">Valiant</span> of
seventy-four guns, I then was,) into the Scheldt, while shells were bursting
over us, and the heavy shot whistling through our rigging—the debarkation
of the British troops—the bombarding and battering of Flushing—the
conflagration of the town—the sorties of the garrison, repulsed, scattered,
and driven back by British bayonets, as quickly and certainly as
the Ocean’s surge is shivered into foam by the perpendicular rocks—the
devastation of the ramparts by the showers of shot and shells for ever
thundering against them—the awful preparation for storm—the capitulation
of the garrison;—all these and many other scenes rose on the intellectual
mirror, and flitted round the mental diorama, as fresh as when they
were first spread before the material eye.</p>

<p>Then came the still darker side of the drama, on which Memory, even
yet shudders to dwell! Our hopes and expectations scattered on the winds—the
great object of the Expedition (French fleet) secured beyond our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
reach, though before our eyes—while our luxurious commander was employed
in eating turtle and throwing the <i>shells</i> at the enemy.</p>

<p>The stimulus of action, the expectation of booty, and the prospect of
battle being withdrawn, vexation and disappointment prepared the way for
the deadly poison of malaria. Now came the “foul fiend of the fens” in
a hundred horrid forms; and, like a destroying angel, mowed down the
ranks of our legions, lingering on these pestiferous plains in disgust or
despair! Happy were they who fell victims, at once, to the destructive
agent. Many of those who survived the endemic, were harassed to their
dying days by repeated attacks of the Walcheren malady.</p>

<p>Yet, on both sides of the river, the country is a luxurious garden,—teeming,
equally, with the necessaries of life and the seeds of death.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The city of Antwerp itself is worthy of a visit, there being numerous
paintings by the Flemish masters of the art, while the citadel
calls forth exciting recollections of valiant assaults, and equally gallant
defences.</p>

<h4>LIEGE.</h4>

<p>Liege is quite metamorphosed—revolutionised—or, more properly speaking,
<i>Cockrellized</i>—within the last twenty years. In times of war, it presented
a picture of peace—and now, in times of peace, it exhibits the
bustle of war. It is no longer the quiet abode of burghers, as in the days
of Quentin Durward! In every direction you observe tall chimnies belching
forth volumes of dense smoke—forges roaring—steam-engines sobbing
hammers clattering—and files grating—all in the preparation and construction
of various kinds of destructive weapons, from a 42-pounder to a
pitchfork! Liege, in fact, is now the Brumagem of Belgium, and can
rival the great British manufactory of metals in no small degree. Musket-barrels
can be procured at Liege for three shillings each! Let England
look to her corn-laws! The “factory system” has not greatly improved
the manners, habits, or morals of Liege. Those who have not visited this
place for ten or fifteen years are astonished at the difference among the
lower order of the people.</p>

<p>The country around Liege, and between that city and Aix and Spa, is
magnificent—equal in beauty, cultivation, and fertility, to the finest parts
of Devonshire—or indeed of any other shire in England. Unlike France
and many parts of the Continent, the country here is spangled with handsome
villas and neat cottages in every direction.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 id="CHAUDE_FONTAINE">CHAUDE FONTAINE.</h3>

<p>About six miles from Liege, on the road to Spa, most beautifully situate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
lies the little warm spring of the above name. The waters are limpid,
inodorous, and tasteless. The temperature is 90½° of Fahrenheit. The
specific gravity is that of common water. It contains small quantities of
carbonic, sulphuric, and muriatic acid, and also some lime. One hundred
pints of this spring yielded 240 grains of saline matters—of which 88
were common salt—91 carbonate of lime—14 sulphate of lime—15 muriate
of magnesia—12 alumine—and 15 silice. They are, therefore, very
analogous to the waters of Pfeffers, Wildbad, and Schlangenbad—and
may be used for the same purposes as their more celebrated contemporaries.
They may be reached in nine or ten hours from Ostende, by the
rail-road. A young lady from England, who bathed in these waters once,
and sometimes twice a day, remarked that she always “felt like eel” after
leaving them, and throughout the same day. I do not exactly know what
the “eel-feel” is, but I can easily believe that it is not precisely that which
the eel itself experiences when it changes its mud-bath for the hands of
the cook.</p>

<p>Thirty miles South of <span class="smcap">Aix-la-Chapelle</span>, and twenty-four South-east
of Liege, embosomed in a sombre but rather romantic valley of the Ardennes,
lies <span class="smcap">Spa</span>, formerly one of the most aristocratic and celebrated
chalybeates of Europe.</p>

<p>We proceed from Liege to Spa along the valley of the Vesdre, and a
more beautiful drive can hardly be met with. I do not think it inferior to
the banks of the Meuse, and it certainly is much more <i>beautiful</i> than many
parts of the Rhine. The sides of the valley are clothed with wood, or
cultivated carefully, from their very summits, and studded with beautiful
villas, cottages, and hamlets, in all directions. At every winding, we see
hundreds of men at work, carrying the new rail-road over rivers and
through the solid rock.</p>

<p>“Cette route charmante decouvre à chaque detour de ravissants vallons
qui laissant aperçevoir au loin des maisons de plaisance, de vieux chateaux,
et de riants villages. Les cotes escarpées des montagnes qui en dessinent
les sinuositées parsemées d’arbres, de rochers, et de precipices.”</p>

<p>At the village of Pepinsterre, about sixteen miles from Liege, we quit
the Aix-la-Chapelle road, and turn up to the right. The whole way from
this to Spa is a constant ascent, the air becoming more bracing, and the
scenery more wild, or of the Ardennes-forest character, till we approach
the town through a triple avenue, the centre one a pavé, and the side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
ones for walking or riding. Spa itself lies in a very picturesque dell, the
eastern side of which is very abrupt, and covered with wood. The houses
are all white and clean, and the locale, altogether, pleased me more than
almost any spa I had previously visited.</p>

<p>Yet the place is comparatively abandoned! We saw very few English
there, and up to the 23d July, 1840, only about a thousand names were
entered on the books, many, perhaps most, of whom were casual visitors,
or merely passengers to other spas! I fear the good citizens of Spa will
not erect a statue to Sir Francis Head.</p>

<p>A catalogue of the emperors, kings, queens, princes, and nobility of all
grades (laying aside the gentry and bureaucracy) who have lined their ribs
with steel, and tanned their slender chylopoietics in the Pouhon or Geronsterre,
would fill a volume. Our countrymen bear a conspicuous part in
this roll of worthies. Henry the Third, of France, visited Spa in the
sixteenth century—in the same, Charles Stuart, having lost his kingdom,
repaired to Spa to regain his health. In 1717, <span class="smcap">Peter the Great</span> drank
the waters of the Pouhon and Geronsterre—in one single year, (1783,)
the list of princes, dukes, and princesses, alone, amounted to 33, besides
the hosts of inferior gentry.</p>

<p>The following history of one of our countrymen, recorded by <span class="smcap">Henry
de Steers</span>, the Sydenham of Spa, is not a little curious:—“In 1620,
arrived here a Milord Anglais, accompanied by his medical attendant.
The College of Physicians in London, who had been consulted in this
case, instead of putting Milord into a strait-waistcoat—or, at all events,
under surveillance, recommended him to the care of De Steers, at Spa.
This unfortunate gentleman laboured under monomania of three distinct
forms, which attacked him periodically, and in succession. During the
first ten days of every month, he neither ate, nor drank, nor spoke. He
kept to his room all the time. On the eleventh morning he would rise
from his bed early, go out a hunting, and come home hungry, eating and
drinking enormously. This was his occupation during the second decade
of the month. In the third decade, the scene entirely changed. He became
passionately fond of music, and squandered hundreds upon the
squallini’s of that day. At the end of the month the taciturnity and
fasting, &amp;c. returned.”</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that De Steers, being unable to prevail on
the monomaniac to drink the Spa waters, the patient returned to England,
and became a furious and confirmed maniac.</p>

<p>“As soon,” says Dr. Dordonville, “as the roads to Spa were rendered
passable, the English, travellers by disposition, and great admirers of the
picturesque, thronged to the fountains, and filled the town by their magnificence.
They loved to expend their riches; and those, whose energetic
passions threw them into dissipation, introduced a fatal and ruinous
luxury.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Although the caprice of fashion, and the attractions of other watering-places
have damaged Spa, it is still resorted to by many people of this
country, and great numbers from France, Belgium, and Germany.</p>

<h4>POUHON.</h4>

<p>This is the most ancient of the springs. It is situated in the middle of
the town, surrounded by a marble basin, whence is bottled immense quantities
of the waters for France, England, Holland, and Germany. Steers,
who practised here for twenty-five years, is not behind his brethren of the
spas, in his eulogies of the Pouhon waters. “They have an agreeable
tartness, and have worked many miracles. Their effects are all but supernatural,
and have excited the curiosity and admiration of physicians and
philosophers who have come here from various countries.”</p>

<p>It is very clear when received into a glass, which becomes covered on
the sides with bubbles of air, that also rise on the surface. The acidulous
and piquant taste is succeeded by a smack of steel. On standing for
some time there is a deposition of iron at the bottom of the glass, in consequence
of the disengagement of carbonic acid. Peter the Great, who
came here exhausted, and menaced with dropsy, completely recovered—and
his statue stands over the Pouhon as no mean certificate of the medicinal
powers of the spring.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">second source</span>, <span class="smcap">Sauveniere</span>, is half a league out of the town,
and situated in a romantic spot. This spa contains less iron than the

<p>From the above it will be seen that iron and large quantity of carbonic
acid gas are the main ingredients in the spa waters—and consequently
that they are simple chalybeates—without aperient qualities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Superb baths have been erected near the Pouhon, for the accommodation
of visitors.</p>

<h4>MEDICINAL AGENCY.</h4>

<p>M. Dordonville is the most recent author on the Spa waters, as he has
resided there for many years, on account of his own health. According
to him, the first perceptible effect of drinking the Spa waters, especially if
taken on an empty stomach, is a slight affection of the head resembling
that which results from taking champaign. Four or five glasses suffice to
produce this phenomenon, especially at first. As this arises from the
carbonic acid gas, it is very transitory. This abundance of gas renders
these waters very pleasant to drink, but they are far from agreeable when
the gas has escaped—and they are then less easy of digestion. Hence the
bottled waters are far less efficacious than at the sources. Since the mania
of Broussais, it has not been uncommon for French visitors to take the
waters mixed with gum Arabic, by which precious mess the springs were
rendered nauseous and indigestible. We may agree with Dr. Dordonville
that the action of Spa waters is not confined to the stomach, but extends
to various organs with which the stomach is bound in sympathy. This
applies to debility of the digestive organs and its consequences; but we
must be cautious how we employ this chalybeate where there are any obstructions
or engorgements of other viscera, merely because they are diuretic,
and promote absorption. Both De Steers of old, and Monsr.
Dordonville, of the present day, assure us that these waters require to be
taken in large doses, and for a considerable time, otherwise they will do
harm instead of good. “Those who cannot take them in this manner
ought to desist from taking them at all.” Mons. D. has seen many people
who have taken from 300 to 350 ounces of the waters daily. <span class="smcap">Peter
the Great</span> generally took twenty-one glasses (three ounces each) every
morning. Dr. D. however, wisely leaves it to the feelings of the patient,
how many goblets he daily takes.</p>

<p>These waters have been found very beneficial in chronic diarrhœa, as
might indeed be expected; but <i>large quantities</i> of any liquid taken in such
cases, are detrimental, especially when conjoined with the pedestrian exercises
that are recommended. We can hardly subscribe to the doctrine
that these chalybeates are beneficial in obstructions of the liver, and enlargments
of the spleen—especially the former, considering that they have no
aperient quality. The same observation applies to enlargement of the
mesenteric glands.</p>

<p>On the kidneys they have an evident action, and <span class="smcap">De Steers</span>, the Sydenham
of his day, calls them <i>vesical</i>.</p>

<p>“The waters of Spa remove heat of the kidneys and bladder, and expel
gravel more effectually than any other remedy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most general effects of these waters is an increase of appetite,
and most patients acquire flesh as well as strength under their use.</p>

<p>It is, however, to people of pallid complexions—leucophlegmatic constitutions—and
general debility, without organic disease, that these waters
may be very useful. The pallid female, affected with complaints peculiar
to the sex, may expect to acquire a healthy complexion, and general
strength from the waters of Spa, assisted by mountain air and daily exercise.
Sterility is one of the many maladies for which they are loudly
praised by the resident physicians.</p>

<p>The sulphuretted chalybeate of the Geronsterre is recommended by Dr.
D. in tuberculous affections of the lungs—a recommendation which needs
confirmation, as the Americans say.</p>

<h4>REGIMEN.</h4>

<p>M. Dordonville remarks that no small portion of those who come to
Spa, do so for pleasure, and not for health. These may eat and drink and
exercise as they would at home. But the invalid must pursue a systematic
regimen. The ancients always recommended aperient medicine previously
to taking mineral waters—and even De Steers made a point of
giving a gentle purgative to his patients every eight or ten days. The
horror of opening medicine entertained by people on the continent, medical
men and all, is productive of infinite mischief, when chalybeate waters,
and all those not aperient, are used. M. Dordonville cautions the drinkers
of Spa very strongly against exposure to cold—a necessary advice in a
mountainous region, where vicissitudes of temperature are frequent. The
waters are best taken early in the morning fasting; or before meals.
Some people drink them at their meals, without injury. Most of the
inhabitants of Spa have no other beverage. In affections of the chest
they may be mixed with milk—especially those of the Geronsterre. M.
Dordonville considers the Spring as the best season for the waters of Spa,
and regrets that tyrant fashion prevents invalids from coming to these
waters till the middle of Summer, or even till Autumn. From five to
fifteen minutes’ interval between the glasses is to be observed, with exercise
during that time. He recommends a light breakfast to be taken at
the fountains, after the waters, where delicious milk, fresh eggs, good
butter, and bread can always be had. From twenty to forty, or even
sixty days are necessary for a complete course of the waters. The same
physician cautions us against compound dishes or the least approach to
repletion while taking the Spa. “The great rock on which patients split
is the pleasures of the table.”</p>

<p>The environs of Spa are very picturesque, and even romantic—the rides
and promenades being extensive and varied in this mountainous region.
The railway from Ostende or Antwerp takes the invalid or visitor to within
twenty-four miles of the Spa, and will soon take him within six miles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the town: and therefore the place may be reached on the third day from
London.</p>

<p>Springing from my couch at five o’clock, in the morning after my
arrival, I first drank a large tumbler of the Pouhon, and started up the
mountain for the Geronsterre. The ascent is constant and rather steep;
but the mountain air gave me fresh vigour, and I reached the fountain
(three miles) without the slightest fatigue. It is prettily situated in a
kind of pleasure-ground, with shaded walks and pleasant benches for
promenade or repose, while taking the waters. The water itself did not
convey to my olfactory nerves that decided odour of sulphuretted hydrogen
which Dr. Dordonville maintains it does. It certainly tastes somewhat
different from the Pouhon, and they urge you to swallow it quickly,
lest the malodorous gas should escape. It was in vain that I told the
Nymph of the Spring that I was not sick, but only drinking the waters
from curiosity. Still she urged, and so did some of the drinkers, that the
most precious ingredient would vanish into air, if I did not gulp it down
in an instant: I now took an eastern road over the brow of the mountain,
through a wild forest, but along a good road, and reached the <span class="smcap">Sauveniere</span>,
after a long walk of nearly three miles. Here I quaffed at the
source whence the Duchess of —— imbibed new life, or at least
renovated health, and hung up her votive tablet, in the shape of a dome
and colonnade, in gratitude to the fountain and its tutelar saint, Apollo.
It tasted to my palate much more inky than its neighbour the Geronsterre,
as, indeed, it ought to do, having more than double the quantity of iron,
and nearly half as much as the Pouhon.</p>

<p>From thence I turned down a narrow road to the <span class="smcap">Tonnelet</span>, about a
mile distant from the Sauveniere. It was the briskest of them all, to my
palate, containing more carbonic acid gas than even the Pouhon. The
chalybeate taste was very marked, and the water, upon the whole, very
pleasant. By this time I had swallowed four large tumblers of mineral
water, and walked seven miles before breakfast, which was very well for
the first morning. I experienced no sensation whatever about my head,
nor any other than a sense of fulness in the stomach, and very little appetite.
Another walk of more than a mile to the town, dissipated the sense
of fulness and brought me an excellent appetite, which was again removed
by eggs, coutelets, potatoes, and coffee, at the hotel de Pays Bas. After
breakfast, the pedestrian exercise was again resumed, and the heights to
the eastward of the town, with all their devious and intricate paths, were
carefully explored. The views from these heights are various and beautiful—the
air delicate and exhilarating. Descending to the town, and
resting half an hour, I repaired to the bathing establishment, close to the
Pouhon, and ordered a mineral water bath, at a temperature of 98°. I
found that the bath-master trusted entirely to his hand, for the regulation
of temperature, and on testing this “rule of thumb” by the thermometer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
he had only made a mistake of six degrees, the instrument exhibiting
104°, instead of 98°. This, however, is very common at all bathing
places. The chalybeate bath produced in me no other sensations than
those arising from saline or plain baths elsewhere. The carbonic acid
was all gone, and the water tasted merely mawkish. It has very little of
the stimulating effects of the Wisbaden or other potent waters. Although
I did not rise from the bath “rajeuné comme un Phœnix,” I experienced
great refreshment after twelve miles’ walking-exercise, and repaired to the
three o’clock table-d’hôte in the <span class="smcap">Pays Bas</span>, with more natural appetite
than I had felt since leaving Modern Babylon. A siesta of an hour
after dinner was equally pleasant and salubrious. After some ramblings
about the town, a visit to the Redout finished the day’s work.</p>

<p>The magnificent “grande salle” in this splendid edifice, was occupied
with the ball, while the “<span class="smcap">Dæmon-robber</span> bands” were plying their
vocation at the end of the room. The play, however, seemed to go on
languidly; and the waltz appeared to have more attractions for the company
than the roulette. The dancers and spectators were by no means
<i>distinguée</i>. There was not one fine woman in the room. We did not
distinguish more than half a dozen English in the whole assembly. They
were almost all French, Flemish, and a few Germans.</p>

<p>Thus ended a <span class="smcap">Spa-day</span> in the Ardennes. I do not recommend an imitation
of it to all those who go to Spa for health. But if the pedestrian
exercise were superseded by equestrian or carriage exercise, I think a
more effectual plan for the recovery of health could hardly be devised. To
those who are very delicate, the paths that are cut along the face of the
wooded precipices overhanging the town, afford most beautiful walks,
sheltered from the winds, and commanding pleasing prospects of Ardennes
scenery. The air there is bracing and elastic.</p>

<p>It is not likely that such a “<span class="smcap">Haven of Health</span>” as this is, should be
without its Cursaal, or gambling-table. The two grand hells are the Redout
and the Vauxhall. A few years before the Revolution the Church sustained
some damage in slander by these mansions of morality. It appears
that the Bishop of Liege, who united a temporal with an eternal concern
for the souls of the good citizens, had granted a monopoly of fifty years
gambling to the proprietors of the Redout—of course without any other
consideration than the advancement of religion and the good of the people.
But a rival establishment (Vauxhall) having been started, the Bishop
issued an ordonnance against the new tables, as not being orthodox. An
appeal was made to the legislature, and the holy canon was reversed, on
the principle that, as in a free state like that of Liege, “every man had a
right to do as he liked with his own”—and as gambling was not contrary
to law, so the Bishop had no right to grant a monopoly to gamblers.
This was an awkward affair; but an amicable arrangement was soon made
between the Bishop and the proprietors of the two hells, by which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
man of God modestly declined a tenth of the spoil, and only accepted a
<i>third</i> of the profits of the tables at the end of each season! “Le <span class="smcap">Prince
Eveque</span> recevra le tiers <span class="smcap">des Benefices</span> que se feront dans ces deux maisons
sur les jeux, apres la saison des Eaux.”</p>

<p>In this way things went on smoothly for a while; when lo! a third
<span class="smcap">Cursaal</span> raised its lofty head to share the spoils of hazard with the noble
firm of “<span class="smcap">Bishop</span>, <span class="smcap">Redout</span>, and <span class="smcap">Vauxhall</span>.” This was too much for
the conscience of M. <span class="smcap">L’Eveque</span>. He justly considered that two royal
roads to the regions of his “<span class="smcap">friend in black</span>” were amply sufficient—and
that to open a third would only be adding another facility to the
already “<i>faciles descensus Averni</i>.” He therefore sent a file of “gens-d’armes”
to turn the tables on these scoffers at the holy command of their
Bishop, which led to wars and bloodshed. The Bishop, finding his palace
of Liege rather warm for him, appealed to the Emperor of Germany—or
rather to Prince Metternich, then at Coblentz. Metternich decided in
favour of the original hells, as being under the benediction of the Bishop,
or perhaps of the Pope—and therefore incapable of doing any thing inconsistent
with the orthodox religion! Soon after this, Metternich and
his master had more important games to play in the French Revolution,
and how Mons. <span class="smcap">Levoz</span>, the unfortunate proprietor of the new Cursaal
fared, this deponent knoweth not.</p>

<p>Spas are under the dominion of more influences than fashion. Who
could have supposed that the medicinal virtues of mineral waters should be
deteriorated or even destroyed by <span class="smcap">politics</span>. Yet such is the case. While
Holland and Belgium were under one crown, the Dutch dolls flocked
annually in great numbers to paint their cheeks in the Pouhon or Geronsterre,
returning to their dykes with a cargo of steel that secured them, for
ten months, against the damps and debilities of their vapoury atmosphere.
But no sooner had the “Braves Belges” revolted, than the chalybeates
of Spa lost all their efficacy, and grass is now likely to grow, and
water to run in the streets of this celebrated place! The Dutch and
most of the English at present resort to the Brunnens of Nassau—the
chalybeates of Brucknau—or the boiling Sprudel, for that health and
renovation which they used to seek and obtain in the forest of the
Ardennes!</p>

<p>It would be equally useless and impertinent in me to attempt a revulsion
in the tide of spa-goers; yet, when I reflect on the locality of Spa—its
facility of access (forty-eight hours from London)—the efficacy of
its waters—the salubrity of its air—the variety of its promenades and
drives—the excellence of its hotels—the cheapness of living—and the seclusion
which is attainable by all—I cannot help regretting that fashion,
caprice, or some inexplicable spell should turn the tide of British invalids
so completely from <span class="smcap">Spa</span>, and impel it with irresistible impetus towards the
<span class="smcap">Brunnens</span> of <span class="smcap">Germany</span>.</p>

<h3 id="AIX-LA-CHAPELLE">AIX-LA-CHAPELLE.</h3>

<p>Antiquity is to a city what noble blood is to an individual. The <i>former</i>
may fall into decay, and the <i>latter</i> into poverty; but the pride of ancestry
supports them both in their fallen greatness. The Romans had excellent
olfactories, and a keen scent for steam or sulphuretted hydrogen gas,
wherever these issued through cracks or fissures of the earth, in their wide
domains. They were very fond of warm baths—and very wisely made
frequent use of them with no small advantage, considering that these
Lords of the Creation had no linen shirts, and wore thick woollen, and
probably somewhat greasy garments next the skin. The boiling cauldron
under Aix poured forth its nauseous and malodorous broth as freely when
Cæsar was mustering his legions on the banks of the Rhine, or when
Charlemagne, many a century afterwards, was uniting his Franco-German
subjects in the same place, as now, when the “<span class="smcap">Dampschippe</span>” and
“<span class="smcap">Chemin de Fer</span>” are daily bringing hundreds of customers and guests
from the distant shores of Albion and Erin. Innumerable Roman relics
are here found—and actual baths were discovered, where the brother of
Nero probably bathed.</p>

<p>Aix is situated in latitude 50° in the midst of a gentle valley, environed,
at some distance, by well-wooded hills. The substratum is calcareous, but
there are unequivocal marks of volcanic agency in the neighbourhood.
The town, like London, presents an old city environed by a new one—especially
towards the Borcette. The old town, in which almost all the
hotels, and indeed the baths are situated, is very irregular, and cedes to
few continental cities in the roughness of its pavements.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fontaine Elisée</span>, the chief or only place for drinking the waters,
is situated exactly between the old and new towns, close to the theatre,
and is one of the handsomest places of the kind amongst the spas of
Germany—forming a remarkable contrast with the Hygeian fonts of Ems,
Wisbaden, and Baden-Baden. In the midst of the façade, 270 feet in
length, rises the rotunda (resembling the Temple of Vesta at Rome) nearly
fifty feet in height, supported by columns, flanked by two open colonnades
ending in cafées, and fronted by a promenade among trees. The fountain,
from which issue two streams, is situated ten or twelve feet below the
colonnade, at the bottom of two flights of marble steps—one for descending
to the font, and the other for ascending from it. There is ample space
in front of the fountain for slowly bibbing the fervid spring. The whole
is surmounted by a marble bust of Hygeia—taken from a German Princess—and
certainly exhibiting more benignity of mein than beauty of
feature. The two High Priests who fill the glasses from the two streams,
have no <i>sinecure</i> of it from six till eight o’clock every morning. I counted
300 drinkers the first morning—and then, being tired, I counted no more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
It must be the reputation, and not the taste or flavour of these waters,
that draws such multitudes of invalids to them every year. The odour of
sulphur is exceedingly strong—the temperature 129° Fahrenheit—the
taste most nauseous—exactly resembling the washings of a gun-barrel,
with a dash of rotten eggs. It is astonishing how soon the palate and
olfactories get reconciled to these and other malodorous waters. On the
second morning I felt little or no repugnance to them. They are clear as
crystal.</p>

<p>The best baths are at the <span class="smcap">Hotel de l’Empereur</span> (where the superior
and hottest source is found), and which is also a very good hotel. The
maitre (Mr. Nuellens) is a pleasant fellow, who speaks English, and is
very attentive to his guests.</p>

<p>As Aix-la-Chapelle is not a place of resort for those who seek pleasure
only, the great body of the real visitors are really invalids, or think themselves
such. The few attendants on sick friends are seldom seen taking
either the waters or baths.</p>

<p>At such a place the experienced eye of the physician can detect, with a
tolerable approach to accuracy, the prevailing maladies for the removal of
which these waters are employed. The drinkers can readily be divided
into three, if not four classes. 1st. I observed a certain proportion, chiefly
females—perhaps a twentieth or thirtieth part of the whole,—who were
clearly “malades imaginaires”—and whose complexions, features, gait,
voices, and condition of body, evinced the absence of all organic disease,
or even functional disorder, of any consequence. They appeared, however,
to be full as anxious to imbibe the prescribed quantity of this terrible compound
of sulphuretted hydrogen gas, muriate of soda and a few other
salts, as any of their neighbours, who shewed too evident marks of corporeal
sufferings.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">second class</span>—and by far the most numerous—were those whose
countenances and tout-ensemble indicated the presence of various functional
disorders—more especially stomach complaints, biliary obstructions,
cutaneous affections, and uterine derangements. A large proportion of
these were likely to benefit from the sulphur salines of Aix. The <span class="smcap">third
class</span> could not be mistaken. The melancholy sequences of apoplectic
attacks (paralysis)—swelled limbs—dropsical effusions of the body—jaundice,—enlarged
livers and spleens—diseases of the heart—last stages of
indigestion—kidney diseases—panting asthma—hectic cough—in short,
the long black catalogue of organic diseases, which no waters but those
of oblivion could ever wash away.</p>

<p>Yet hope, which clings to the human heart, had collected this unfortunate
class—and not in very small numbers—round the fountain and the
baths—to return to their homes with blighted expectations, there to linger
out a wretched existence!</p>

<p>The German physicians appear to be convinced that mineral springs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
are not merely waters impregnated with various mineral and gaseous
matters, with or without increase of temperature; but that they are possessed
of <i>vitality</i>—living beings, in fact, whose life is transfused into the
human organism, thereby communicating energy to the solids and purity
to the fluids of our bodies—in other words, correcting and expelling disease
and restoring health! Even the venerable <span class="smcap">Alibert</span> was smitten with
this German transcendentalism, and he observes of the Aix waters—“these
springs, under the empire of Nature, most undoubtedly enjoy a
species of <i>vitality</i> (une sorte de vitalité) in common with other living
bodies on this globe. They are <i>animated</i> by a multitude of principles,
which will long, perhaps for ever, elude the most laborious researches of
chemistry. The waters of Aix-la-Chapelle, whether used internally or in
baths, act as potent restorers of vital energies. Their constituents are
powerfully aided in efficacy by the high temperature and the impregnation
of divers gases. Taken internally they excite the action of the abdominal
viscera—detach mucosities and other morbid secretions, and evacuate
them by the bowels, kidneys, and skin. The inhalation of the vapour
rising from these waters has been very serviceable in many cases of pulmonary
affections.”</p>

<p>This <i>vitality</i> hypothesis did not escape the notice of my friend Dr.
Granville, who appears, however, to have thought it rather too large for
John Bull to swallow, without some qualification. He therefore substituted
“caloricity” for “vitality,” in order that so good an idea might
not be lost—and that some <i>mysterious</i> agency might aid the natural operation
of the German spas. This mode of explaining the <i>ignotum</i> by the
<i>ignotius</i> is, no doubt, very ingenious; but, for my own part, I shall at
once acknowledge my ignorance, not only of the manner in which mineral
waters are formed in the bowels of the earth, but of their <i>specific</i> action
(if any) on the human frame.</p>

<p>The spa doctors candidly allow that the waters of Aix, “if taken too
hot and in quantities too large, may produce irritation, and even purgation.
But the latter is not a very common effect of these waters. In
small doses they are favourable to digestion; and, taken in moderation,
they are not calculated to weaken.” As baths, these waters act on the
surface, and, by sympathy, on the internal organs, exciting the nervous,
secreting, and circulating organs. The temperature of the blood (98°) is
considered the best for the bath. “If taken at a higher degree, or too
often, they are dangerous.”</p>

<p>Let us now advert to the bill of fare which Alibert, Monheim, Zillerland,
Dordonville, Reumont, and others, have spread before the invalids resorting
to Aix-la-Chapelle. I shall endeavour, here and elsewhere, to form
some scale or estimate of the probable, doubtful, and dangerous agency of
the waters and baths.</p>

<p>The foregoing is a tolerably copious list of maladies which may be
benefitted by the waters of Aix-la-Chapelle—and from their sensible qualities
and long-established reputation, there is little doubt but that <i>fashion</i>
has drawn away from them to other more favoured places, many who
would have derived great advantage from their use. The remarks on
drinking, bathing, and preparatory measures, will be found under the head
of <span class="smcap">Ems</span>, to prevent repetition.</p>

<p>About a mile and a half from the “Fontaine Elisée,” in a romantic
little dell, over which the rail-road will soon pass, lies Borcette. The
waters resemble those of Aix-la-Chapelle, but they are (one of the sources)
entirely devoid of the sulphuretted hydrogen gas. The temperature is
about 150° Fahr. The water is clear, and has an acidulous taste. There
is one source where the waters are sulphurous. Latterly a chalybeate
spring has been discovered here. Borcette is more quiet, and the air
fresher than in the town, and the baths are a good deal frequented. The
new town, from the Fontaine Elisée to Borcette, is very handsome, and
the theatre is a most beautiful building.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 id="EMS">EMS.</h3>

<p>No German spa is better known to the English than <span class="smcap">Ems</span>, lying in a narrow
valley of the Lahn river, only six miles from Coblentz, in the Duchy
of Nassau. The town is built on the right bank of the little river, and the
slate hills rise almost perpendicularly behind it. The sun’s beams are
collected into a focus there, during a great part of the day, and the air is
hot and sultry. These hills, on both sides, are covered with vines, trees, or
cultivation. The walks about Ems are not so well shaded as at Wisbaden
and some other watering-places in Nassau; but there are plenty of donkeys
and guides to take the invalids up to the higher grounds for pure air. The
environs are very pretty, especially the road to Nassau, about five miles
from Ems.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>These waters did not escape the notice of the Romans, whose coins and
other vestiges have been found there. The waters issue from the foot of
the eastern slate mountain (Mont de Bains) and their sources are hidden
from human eye and investigations.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> They are clear and transparent as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
crystal, when first drawn in a clean glass. The chief fountains are the
<span class="smcap">Kesselbrunnen</span> and the <span class="smcap">Krachenchen</span>—the <i>first</i> has a temperature
of 115° of Fahrenheit—the <i>latter</i>, only 83°. These are the drinking
springs. There are several others, varying in temperature from 80° to 124°,
and used as baths. Some of them are about the temperature of the blood,
and fit for general bathing, without increase or reduction. They have the
taste of chicken-broth, with a slight smack of iron. They preserve their
physical qualities (excepting temperature) for forty-eight hours, uncorked—when
corked and sealed, they are said to keep good for several months.
They are light and easy of digestion.</p>

<p>The Ems waters are eminently alkaline. A pint (of the Kesselbrunnen)
contains 20 grains of bicarbonate of soda—two of carbonate of the same—two
of carbonate of magnesia—one of sulphate of soda—one of common
salt (muriate of soda)—and a very minute trace of iron. All the
springs contain nearly the same ingredients—but the Krachenchen shews
much more carbonic acid gas than the Kesselbrunnen, on account of its
lower temperature.</p>

<p>Thilenius (the elder and younger) the Nestors of Ems, make the following
observations on the waters.</p>

<p>“They operate on the human constitution mildly but efficiently, with
little disturbance to the functions of the body. On this account they agree
well with delicate persons, whose nerves are morbidly sensitive,—the sad
effects of mental emotions, civilized life, and other debilitating causes.
They are, therefore, peculiarly suited to the female constitution.—They
may be employed, too, in advanced stages of disease, where other mineral
waters of more exciting qualities, would be inadmissible. Their alkaline
properties enable them to resolve obstructions, and free the functions of
the kidneys, skin, liver, and various other secreting organs—especially
the uterine vessels. They correct tenacious and morbid bile, as well as
acidities—and thus prove aperient in a mild degree. Their intimate connexion
with carbonic and sulphuretted hydrogen gas enables them to give
activity to the secreting vessels, and evacuate unhealthy humours, while
they give vigour to the whole organism, oppressed by chronic diseases.
They have, at the same time, a soothing and tranquillizing effect on the
nervous system. No waters, with the exception of Schlangenbad, produce
such a pleasing and salutary operation on the skin, which they
cleanse, soften, and leave in a sattiny state, thus improving the complexion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and clearing the pores. They are potent in discussing glandular swellings,
and promoting absorption of abnormal deposits.”</p>

<p>The foregoing exposition of the general effects of the Ems waters is
more rational, modest, and just, than we shall usually find in the
eloges of most other spa doctors. We shall now give a catalogue of the
particular maladies for which these waters are specially recommended—marking,

<p>From this ample <i>carte des maladies</i> (and I have omitted several which
will not bear publication in this country) the valetudinarian will be able to
select the dish that suits his taste—or rather the evil which he wishes to
discharge. I have endeavoured to estimate the value of the remedy.
Thilenius, indeed, expresses an apprehension that readers may be sceptical
as to the power of one remedy curing so many and such different diseases.
But he says—“let the sceptic come and see.” Who can combat the following
argument?—“The result of our most profound researches is the
firm persuasion that mineral waters are the gifts of Divine mercy to suffering
humanity.” The same might be said of every medicine; but medicines
often do harm, and so do mineral waters, unless administered with prudence.
It will be seen that the stigma of No. 3 (dangerous) has been
affixed in no instance to the Ems waters; but this applies to drinking them
and not to bathing. I cannot too often repeat my conviction that there
is far more mischief produced by spa-bathing than by spa-bibbing—especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
in the case of the Ems waters, which are by no means of such an
exciting nature as those of Wisbaden and several other warm springs. In
every case where there is either local inflammation or constitutional excitement,
these and other thermal waters are dangerous as baths.
Thilenius himself remarks as follows:</p>

<p>“The condition of the body, when these waters are used, may be compared
to that in which a kind of fever exists. It includes a period of four
or six weeks, or even longer, in inveterate maladies. In this period, the
waters exert their influence for the removal of the disease. This influence
is felt, sooner or later. It is more or less distinctly perceptible, according
to the nature of the complaint. It manifests itself, generally, by a kind
of languor, in which the patient expresses himself as being ‘affected by
the waters.’”</p>

<p>The waters of Ems have had greater reputation in affections of the
chest than most other mineral springs, in consequence of the strong
recommendation of Hufeland, who observes:—“We know how few
mineral springs there are that can be used with safety in diseases of the
lungs. Patients with such affections are commonly prohibited from visiting
a mineral spring. Here the reverse is the case; and, in my opinion,
Ems stands alone, with Selters, in this respect.”</p>

<p>It is quite evident, however, that it is in the more incipient cases of
pulmonary diseases only, that Ems could be of any service—namely, where
the tubercles are few in number, and in an unexcited condition—where
the cough is slight, and the expectoration merely mucous, without fever
or emaciation. In affections of the trachea, however, dependent on chronic
inflammation of the mucous membrane, the waters and locality of Ems
have been found highly beneficial, as the crowds of people from all parts
of Germany can testify. It really would be well worth trying Ems, in
such cases, before undertaking a long journey to Pisa or Rome.</p>

<p>Since the above was written, and while staying at Ems, in July, 1840,
I met with a recent work by Dr. Doring, bath physician at Ems, from
which I think it proper to make some extracts.</p>

<p>“Among all the maladies which are alleviated or cured by the waters of
Ems, the affections of the chest are of the first consideration.</p>

<p>1. <i>Pulmonary Complaints having their origin in other parts of the body.</i>—Where
these result from congestion or engorgement of the viscera of
the abdomen, connected with gout.</p>

<p>2. <i>Loss of voice, hoarseness, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>Chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane of the larynx, trachea,
and bronchia.</i>—When this affection has attained the name and nature of
pituitary phthisis, the waters of Ems work wonders, especially where this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
state depends on latent gout, rheumatism, or repelled cutaneous complaints.
The <span class="smcap">Kesselbrunnen</span> is very efficacious in such conditions of the mucous
membrane. If the malady has not advanced beyond the limits of curability,
the warm baths prove auxiliary to the internal use of the water.</p>

<p>4. <i>Chronic inflammation of the substance of the lungs themselves.</i></p>

<p>5. <i>Debility of the chest.</i>—However vague and inexact this term, there
is a <i>disposition</i> to pulmonary disease to which it may be applied, and which
it is of great importance to recognize. One of the chief symptoms is a
susceptibility to colds, or irritability of the mucous membrane of the chest,
accompanied by oppression, weight, and hacking cough. If this be neglected,
it may lead to serious disease. A protracted course of the Kesselbrunnen,
repeated for several seasons, has been found very efficacious in
such states of the respiratory apparatus.</p>

<p>6. <i>Tubercles of the lungs; or pulmonary consumption.</i>—This dreadful
malady, which cuts off such prodigious numbers of the human race, is
more frequently arrested in its progress by the <span class="smcap">Kesselbrunnen</span>, than by
any other remedy. At the same time it is proper to remark that neither
this nor any other remedy will prove efficacious, if the disease be confirmed.
It is where the tubercles are in a nascent or latent state, that the Ems waters
tend to purify the blood, and prevent further deposition of tuberculous
matter in the air-cells. Perhaps, too, they may cause absorption of those
already deposited. It need hardly be urged that the earlier the waters are
used the better.</p>

<p>7. In obstinate and neglected <i>catarrhs of the mucous membrane of the
trachea and larynx</i>, the Kesselbrunnen has produced the most beneficial
effects.</p>

<p>8. <i>Spitting of blood.</i>—If this proceeds from irritability of the lungs
themselves—from active congestion—or general plethora, the Ems waters
will be absolutely injurious. But if the hæmorrhage be symptomatic of
disordered conditions of the liver and other abdominal organs, then, the
Ems waters taken internally, but not as baths, may prove serviceable. The
same reasoning will apply to asthma.</p>

<p>9. <i>Scrofula.</i>—Daily experience has proved the efficacy of the alkaline
waters of Ems in scrofulous affections generally.</p>

<p>10. <i>Nervous disorders.</i>—The waters of this spa have a singularly
soothing and tranquillizing effect on the nervous system, as great numbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of patients can annually testify. Hence they are much used in hypochondriasis,
neuralgia, tic douloureux, periodical head-aches, chorea, &amp;c.</p>

<p>11. <i>Congestions</i> of the liver and abdominal organs generally—hæmorrhoids—jaundice—engorgements
and indurations of the uterus, ovaries,
&amp;c.—colics, cramps, and epigastric pains—heart-burns—vomitings, &amp;c.
These are all ameliorated or cured by the waters of Ems.</p>

<p>12. <i>Gout.</i>—The action of the Ems waters on the constitution is to
throw out the morbid matter from the blood—the cause of this painful
malady in all the normal and irregular forms. At the same time, if the
malady be of long standing, and the individual of weakly constitution, the
waters of Wisbaden or Carlsbad will be more efficacious than those of
Ems.</p>

<p>13. <i>Rheumatism.</i>—The same observations will apply to this as to gout.</p>

<p>14. <i>Chronic eruptions and ulcerations of the skin</i> are greatly benefitted
by this spa.</p>

<p>15. <i>Disorders of the urinary organs.</i>—In no class of disorders have the
Ems waters gained more reputation than in this, including catarrh of the
bladder, gravel, stone, diabetes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>16. <i>Catamenial irregularities.</i>—Females from all parts of Europe resort
to the waters of Ems for the cure of these troublesome complaints, including
sterility, chlorosis, &amp;c.”<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>I have introduced this quotation from one of the most recent writers on
the waters of Ems, and himself a practitioner there, of considerable repute;
but do not, and cannot vouch for the strict accuracy of all the
observations contained in it. As in most of the writings of spa doctors,
it must be taken “cum grano salis.”</p>

<h4>COUNTERINDICATIONS.</h4>

<p>According to Dr. Doring, these are as follow:—</p>

<p>1. The Ems waters are hurtful in all acute or subacute inflammations
of any organ or structure whatever.</p>

<p>2. In people of florid complexions or plethoric constitutions, especially
if there be any disposition to hæmorrhages, or determination to the head.</p>

<p>3. In dropsical effusions of chest, abdomen, or cellular membrane.</p>

<p>4. In organic diseases of heart or great vessels.</p>

<p>5. In confirmed consumption, and in marasmus from whatever cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<h4>POINT OF SATURATION, OR CRISIS.</h4>

<p>The Crises produced by the waters of Ems are not so distinct and frequent
as those resulting from some of the more potent spas. They act
more gently and more slowly than the generality of mineral waters.
Nevertheless, the following observations of Dr. Doring are to be carefully
attended to.</p>

<p>“There are certain cases, constitutions, and forms of disease, in which
it would be unsafe to continue the Ems waters up to the point of saturation.
Thus if, after two or three weeks’ course, there occur little indispositions
or discomforts—feelings of debility—a sense of prostration—a
change of usual temper—an increase of sensibility; or even an irritability
or moroseness—an unusual propensity to sleep, with agitating
dreams—a loss of appetite—or, on the contrary, a thirsty white tongue,
bitter taste in the mouth, oppression and distention of stomach, derangement
of bowels and kidneys, and acceleration of pulse—it is then time
to lessen the quantity of the waters, or entirely to stop them for some
days. The foregoing are indications of over-drinking, or over-bathing, to
which the term <i>ueberbaden</i> is given, and should never be neglected.”</p>

<p>As at Wisbaden, there is occasionally an eruption on the skin, after a
few baths, and this is considered to be critical.</p>

<p>Thilenius, contrary to the custom of most of the spa doctors, admits
that, although the waters alone cure many disorders, yet, in a great many
cases, appropriate medicines are absolutely necessary. He contends, however,
and I believe with justice, that many diseases give way to the combination
of the waters and medicine, which resist the latter, if unaided by
the former.</p>

<p>The preparation for the waters of Ems, as of all other mineral springs,
is of the greatest importance, and is but too little attended to. Many
patients repair to these sources, either exhausted by long-continued illness
and the fatigues of the journey, or in a state of excitability from tonics
and other medicines. In the one case some restorative remedies are to be
exhibited, and in the other, quietude and saline aperients are necessary
before the waters are used, internally or externally. Temperance is indispensible
both before and during the use of the waters.</p>

<h4>GENERAL RULES FOR TAKING THE WATERS AND BATHS.</h4>

<p>The best season is between the beginning of May and the end of September.
The waters are taken early in the morning. Weakly persons
should begin with small portions, till they are accustomed to the springs.
The morning is also considered the best time for bathing. The patient
should immerse himself slowly—first to the knees—and afterwards the
whole body, having first sponged the face and neck. Those who are subject
to determinations of blood to the head should keep a handkerchief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
moistened with cold water to the head during the bath. A bladder of
cold water is still better. The individual should not lie quiet in the bath,
and much less should he go to sleep. He should keep constantly rubbing
or sponging the body or limbs—and if not able to do this, a servant should
do it for him. He should not remain more than ten minutes in the water,
at first—and he should gradually increase the time to half an hour or
more. Those whose skins are very sensitive ought to bathe in a flannel
dress. The temperature should be from 94° to 98° of Fahrenheit. On
leaving the bath, the individual ought to wrap himself up in a warm
sheet, and when dry to dress himself. It is recommended then to retire
to his bed-room and remain lying on the bed for a quarter or half an hour,
but without sleeping. Those who are aged, weakly, or nervous, may take
a glass of milk or a cup of coffee, after the bath. Most people can take
a glass of milk and Ems waters mixed. The latest time for bathing is
two hours before dinner. One bath in the day is quite sufficient.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>The waters are drunk, sometimes before, sometimes after bathing.
They should be sipped warm at the source, otherwise some of their volatile
qualities are lost. The quantity taken, like that of food, must be
regulated by the power of digestion. Too much water, like too much
food, will produce the same distention and discomfort of stomach. The
same temperance and frugality is necessary in both cases. From two to
three wine-glassfuls of the waters taken twice, thrice, or four times, at
intervals of a quarter of an hour, will in general be sufficient. Some cow’s
or goat’s milk may be mixed with the waters. Gentle exercise, between
the doses of water, is essentially necessary. In some cases it may be
proper to take a few glasses of the waters two or three hours after dinner—not
sooner.</p>

<p>Asthmatic people, and those labouring under serious maladies of vital
organs, are recommended to take a few glasses of the waters in their
beds, early in the morning—but never to exceed a pint in this way.</p>

<p>A light breakfast may be allowed in half an hour or an hour after the
last tumbler of water at the springs. It is fortunate that near this, as
near most alterative waters, there is a chalybeate—viz. Schwalbach—where
the patient may be very conveniently sent, when no farther progress
is likely to be made at Ems; or where a tonic is necessary after the debilitating
effects of the latter have taken place. Those who cannot visit
Ems may take the bottled waters at a distance, with very little loss of
virtue. They will keep for several months. They are used with considerable
benefit <i>en lavement</i>. Of the <i>douches</i> or local application of the waters
to the ailing region, I need not speak.</p>

<p>The regimen, while taking these and other waters, is of some consequence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Coffee or chocolate half an hour after the last glass, with bread
but no butter, is the rule of the day at Ems. Tea is prohibited, as too
much favouring perspiration—a rather unnecessary precaution I imagine.
A liquid preparation of rice (called <i>content</i>) with some spice, is recommended
to those of very nervous temperaments for breakfast. Between
breakfast and dinner, some light avocation, conversation, or reading—after
which a promenade. Temperance is essentially necessary at these waters,
as they generally excite the appetite. The dinner hour of one o’clock at
the <span class="smcap">table-d’hôtes</span> is a great bore to all who are not downright ill—and
these had better dine at home. The siesta is condemned in strong terms
by Thilenius, if there be any fulness about the head, or if the individual
be plethoric; but to the weakly this indulgence is allowed. The early
dinner draws after it, as a necessary consequence, some supper—so that,
upon the whole, the four o’clock dinner, without supper, will be found the
most convenient and salutary.</p>

<p>Of the gambling-tables I shall take another opportunity to speak:
mean time the following remark of Thilenius will not be inappropriate
here.</p>

<p>“He who cannot gamble <i>without losing his temper</i>, should avoid the
hazard-tables.” This is easy morality! The physical effects of passion
and all the horrible emotions of mind at roulette, are merely considered as
hurtful to the body of the bather; but no idea appears to be entertained
that these are detrimental to the soul as well as to the body. The fact is,
however, that none but gamblers by profession, and not all of them, can
win or lose money without passion, although they may contrive not to
shew it strongly in their countenances. In every point of view, therefore,
moral and physical, these hells on earth ought to be shunned as
eagerly as those of the nether regions.</p>

<p>I may now make a few cautionary remarks on the dangers of bathing
and drinking the waters of Ems, and indeed of mineral waters (thermal)
in general—a subject little touched upon by writers at the spas themselves.
I cannot too often or too strongly warn every one against warm baths, who
has the slightest degree of local chronic inflammation going on in any
of the organs of the body, as evinced by white tongue, dryness of skin,
accelerated pulse, evening thirst, or scanty action of the kidneys. The
exciting mineral waters, taken internally or externally, will be almost certain
to raise the chronic into a subacute, or even acute, inflammation,
with a corresponding grade of constitutional irritation. Of this I have
seen many instances, both at home and abroad. The existence of such
conditions should be carefully ascertained before the spa is introduced: and
proper means taken to remove all traces of inflammation. But even where
there is no proof of any inflammatory action, the state of plethora or
general fulness of the vessels renders warm bathing hazardous. In all, or
almost all organic diseases of internal parts, especially of the heart, brain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
or lungs, the warm bath is to be eschewed. The tide of the circulation
carried to the surface by the hot bath, must have a subsequent recoil, and
then the weakened organ may suffer. Besides, the warm and, still more,
the hot bath excites the heart and great vessels into increased activity for
the time, and the blood is carried with greater force towards the brain,
endangering congestion there. But what are the admonitory symptoms
or phenomena by which the patient may judge, when danger is approaching?
The spa doctor is not always at hand, in these emergencies. He is
often too much employed at such times. When giddiness, sleepiness,
chilliness, confusion of thought, weariness, head-ache, pains in the limbs,
unusual sounds in the ears, sparks before the eyes, loss of appetite,
oppression after food, feverishness, thirst, languor, depression of spirits,
inability to sleep at the usual hour, malaise or, in fact, any uncomfortable
feeling, not previously felt, occurs soon after drinking the waters, and
especially after bathing, and if these, or any of these recur after the second
or third day, let the waters be suspended till advice is taken. I am well
aware that the spa-doctors will say—“oh these are critical, or even
favourable symptoms, demonstrating the efficiency of the spring.” All
I say is—<i>Beware!</i> you are standing on a precipice!</p>

<p>We must now take leave of Ems. It is a very hot place in warm
weather, and I must say that the exterior and interior of the houses are
not in the most perfect accordance. The fogs are frequent in the mornings,
and the heat oppressive in the middle of the day. Few people can sleep
without some of the windows being kept open, and the danger of catching
colds is not inconsiderable. The reputation of the waters is very extended.
The Empress of Russia and her daughter were swallowing them freely
while we were there (1840), and seemed to require them or some other
restoratives, as they exhibited any thing but hyperborean complexions.
Several physicians have recommended a residence at this spa during the
Winter; and I am inclined to think that it would not be a bad sejour for
people with tracheal affections, or irritable conditions of the mucous membrane
of the lungs.</p>

<h3 id="FRANKFORT">FRANKFORT.</h3>

<p>This celebrated city has changed its nature, but not its name—the <i>latter</i>
being now more appropriate than ever. It is a <span class="smcap">free-fort</span>, that is, it is
free from fort or citadel—rampart or fosse—glacis or sallyport—cannon
or mortar—shot or shells! All these have been converted into much better
things—gardens, shrubberies, and promenades. Frankfort, I apprehend,
has more of nominal freedom than real liberty. The protection of the
German potentates is stronger, no doubt, than her ancient walls; but
she is as much under the surveillance and control of these “<span class="smcap">high
mightinesses</span>,” as ever she was under that of her military commandants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
when a first rate fortress. Be that as it may, Frankfort is now a great
emporium or re-union of commerce and carriages—of Jews and of Gentiles—of
bankers and of brokers—of lenders and of venders—of consuls
and of caléches—of voitures and of retours—of envoyés and employés—in
fine, it is a large “normal school” for studying the first lines of diplomacy,
trickery, traffic, and stock-jobbery.</p>

<p>The old and the new portions of the city present a curious contrast—youth
and beauty united to age and ugliness!</p>

<p>One of the great lions of Frankfort is the cemetery, a few miles out of
town. It is a huge “painted sepulchre,” marble without, and mummy
within. This “city of the dead,” is not much smaller than its neighbour
of the living. True, the mansions are on a smaller scale, and the chambers
are low, dark, and unventilated; yet their inhabitants—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">shew no symptoms of discontent, feuds, or family quarrels. They sleep
without dreams, unagitated by the habitual passions which invade the
bosoms of those whom they have left in the busy city on the banks of the
Main. If the rage for cemetrical building goes on at the present rate of
impulse, a time must come, when the cities of the dead will equal, both in
number and extent, those of the living—and necessity will then compel
the <i>latter</i> to have recourse to the ancient mode of sepulture—incineration.
A small urn, instead of a costly tomb, will then hold the ashes of our
friends and ourselves, without any encroachment on the soil that supplies
us with food, fuel, and raiment. And, after all, this seems a less revolting
process of preserving some frail memorial of those we loved and honoured,
than that of committing them to the earth, there to “lie in cold obstruction,
and to rot,” the prey of worms, and all crawling things!</p>

<p>I believe there are few people, of reflective minds, who can wander round
the splendid cemetery or lonely churchyard, perusing the brief memoirs of
the silent inhabitants below, without feeling some of those sentiments and
emotions, which Hervey cloathed in language. These records of the dead,
short as they are, will be found, each, to contain at least two facts or truths—the
birth and death of the individual. I wish as much could be always
said for the lengthy biographies of the living! These authentic documents—these
“bills of mortality”—teach us one important truth, viz.—that
<span class="smcap">life</span> is a loan, and not a gift, granted to a piece of clay, without
interest indeed, but with the power of resumption at the pleasure of the
lender, with or without notice. <span class="smcap">Death</span>, again, is nothing more than the
payment of a debt—the surrender of a policy. Has man any just cause
to murmur at the shortness or uncertainty of life, because the vital spark
animates, without solicitation, his atom of earth—sparkles for a few moments—is
extinguished by the same invisible hand—and is reduced again
to dust? If this be all, if the brief existence of man be “rounded by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
sleep,” he has little cause to be proud of the intelligence which distinguishes
him from the inferior animals. <span class="smcap">He</span> alone, of all created beings,
knows that he must die—a bitter thought at all times—and cruelly bestowed,
if death be annihilation! As we see no proofs of injustice in the other
works of the Creator, it is fair to presume that there is none here, and
that the fore-knowledge of death in this world is indicative of life in
another.</p>

<p>If an inhabitant of another planet were to visit our cemeteries, graveyards
and churches, perusing the necrological literature of those localities,
he would soon come to the conclusion that this our little Globe was a perfect
Paradise, inhabited by the most amiable of all God’s finite creatures.
Every stone would present him authentic proofs that the whole community
consisted of affectionate fathers, loving husbands, virtuous wives, indulgent
parents, dutiful children, and sincere friends! What would be
his astonishment when, on mixing in the busy haunts of men, he found
them everywhere engaged in public wars or private quarrels—in litigations,
persecutions, robberies, and assassinations—torn with all the vile passions
of envy, hatred, malice, jealousy, and malevolence—distorting the good
actions of their neighbours, and exaggerating their failings—violating the
laws of Nature, and evading the laws of man—in fine, exhibiting a picture
the very reverse of that which he found delineated on the tablets of
the departed!</p>

<p>In this perplexity, he would fly back to his native planet, and report
that the inhabitants of <span class="smcap">Terra</span> were a race of beings inexplicable in their
character—the dead all <span class="smcap">angels</span>—the living all <span class="smcap">devils</span>! And yet nothing
would be more erroneous than such a report. The haunts of the living
and the habitats of the dead—the city and the cemetery—the cheerful
village and the country church-yard, being found to contain the same relative
proportion of good and evil spirits. The reason of the discrepancy
above alluded to, has been appreciated in all ages—“de mortuis nil nisi
bonum.” The shroud is our last and kindest mantle. Its texture is so
close as to conceal all our vices—but at the same time so transparent as to
reveal all our virtues. It is not then on tombstones that we are to seek
for truth!</p>

<h3 id="KISSENGEN">KISSENGEN.</h3>

<p>This is comparatively a young cub amongst the great spa-lions of the
Continent; but it is one that is likely to attain an immense size. Dr.
Balling, resident physician at this spa, and, still later, Dr. Welsch, son-in-law
of Dr. Maas, have published on these waters.</p>

<p>Kissengen is situated almost in the heart of Germany, in the kingdom
of Bavaria, and can be reached in two or three days from Frankfort. The
waters issue from the earth in a valley stretching from north to south—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
surrounding heights, covered with woods, and not averaging more than
600 feet in altitude. The valley itself is fertile in corn, wine, and fruits.
The little river <span class="smcap">Saale</span> runs through the centre of it. Kissengen is nearly
equidistant from Wurtsburg, Bamberg, Meiningen, and Fulda. Its latitude
is 49° 50´, north—and it is not more than 600 feet above the level
of the sea.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The temperature, from April till October, is moderately
warm. In consequence of the great evaporation of saline water at the
salt springs, the atmosphere is a good deal impregnated with saline principles,
and is similar to sea-air. It is considered beneficial in all scrofulous
affections.</p>

<p>There are a great many mineral springs here, but it will only be necessary
to notice the Maxbrunnen—Ragotzy—Pandur—Soolensprudel—and
Theresienbrunnen.</p>

<p>1. <i>Maxbrunnen.</i>—This rises near the Cursaal and Conversation-house,
with a bubbling or boiling noise—clear as crystal, and exhaling its gaseous
pearls with great rapidity. The carbonic acid gas adheres to the sides of
a glass and gives the water a milky appearance. All the springs of
Kissengen abound in this gas. The temperature is 52° Summer and
Winter. The taste is acidulous and refreshing. According to Kastner
(1833) a pint of this spring contains nearly 30½ grains of solid matters,
and 31 inches of carbonic acid gas. The principal ingredients are 18½
grains of muriate of soda—1 grain ditto of potash—3 grains muriate of
magnesia—2½ grains of carbonate of lime—1½ grains of sulphate of soda—1
grain sulphate of lime. This spring contains no trace of iron.</p>

<p>2. <i>Ragoczy, or Ragotzy.</i>—At the southern extremity of the colonnade
is seen this spring, together with that of the <span class="smcap">Pandur</span>. The Ragoczy rises
with considerable noise, discharging air-bubbles freely. The water is not
so clear as that of the Maxbrunnen—having a blueish cast. The temperature
is nearly the same as the other. The taste is salt and bitter, with a degree
of astringency. But the taste varies very much from day to day—at one
time the salt, at another the bitter, predominates, with, occasionally, a
ferruginous savour. It requires four large pumps to exhaust the spring.</p>

<p>The pint contains 85 grains of solid matters, and 26 cubic inches of
carbonic acid gas. Of these 85 grains, 62 are common salt—6 muriate
of magnesia—3 carbonate of lime—2 carb. magnesia—2 sulphate of soda—2<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
sulphate of lime—2 silex. The other six grains are immaterial, except
the subcarbonate of iron, of which there are three-quarters of a grain
in each pint.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Pandur.</i>—Only 34 feet distant from the Ragoczy, the Pandur
springs to light, with great noise and bubbling. Its taste is more salt, bitter,
pure, and piquant than that of the Ragoczy—“and is much more relished by
the ladies.” It is so plentiful that it can furnish from eight hundred to a
thousand baths daily. The pint contains 76 grains of solids—of which,
57 are muriate of soda—5 muriate of magnesia—5 carbonate of lime—2
carb. of magnesia—about half a grain of subcarbonate of iron—1¾ grs.
of sulphate of soda—28 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas.</p>

<p>4. <i>Soolensprudel.</i>—About a mile from the foregoing springs, and in
the middle of the valley, near the bank of the river, this remarkable spring
was discovered by boring 311 feet through the earth. It does not flow
in an even uninterrupted stream, but rises and falls at irregular periods—often
with a noise resembling cannon. It generally ebbs and flows eight
or nine times in the twenty-four hours. When the water is at its greatest
height, it boils, and roars, and foams at a great rate. This spring rises
through a salt-water mine, if the expression can be used. Its solid contents
are enormous, namely 172 grains in the pint! Of these, common
salt alone amounts to 107½ grains—muriate of magnesia 24½ grains—muriate
of lime 4 grains—sulphate of soda 25 grains—carbonate of magnesia
6½ grains—carbonate of lime 1½ grains—subcarbonate of iron not
quite half a grain—carbonic acid gas 30½ cubic inches. From this it will
be seen that, in solid ingredients, the Soolensprudel outstrips all the
other springs. In temperature too, it differs from the others, being 66°,
or as nearly as possible that of the sea.</p>

<p>5. <i>Theresienbrunnen.</i>—This springs from a depth of 140 feet, and discharges
itself with a bubbling noise like the others. The water is clear
as crystal, and whitens the sides of the glass with the carbonic acid gas.
The temperature is 52 or 3°. The taste is tart, saltish, agreeably pleasant
and refreshing. The quantity furnished is abundant. There are 29½
grains of saline matters in the pint, with 28½ cubic inches of carbonic acid
gas. Of these, 18½ grains are muriate of soda—2¾ muriate of magnesia—2½
carb. magnesia—2 carb. lime—1½ sulphate of soda, with some slight
quantities of minor ingredients.</p>

<p>Between this spring and the Maxbrunnen there is a considerable affinity;
but the Theresienbrunnen has the advantage, in possessing a greater proportion
of carbonic acid gas, by which the saline matters are held in more
complete solution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<h4>MEDICINAL EFFECTS AND PROPERTIES OF THE KISSENGEN WATERS.</h4>

<p>The various springs, in their physical and chemical properties, have one
common and characteristic physiognomy. They rise from mountains of
the same formation, and with more or less identity of force. They all
contain abundance of muriate of soda and carbonic acid gas. “Mineral
waters, however, cannot be estimated merely by their physical and chemical
qualities. Each spring is an organic whole (<i>ensemble organique</i>), and
possesses its peculiar mode of existence—‘et a sa propre maniere d’etre.’”<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
“In general, the springs of Kissengen, when taken internally, excite the
nutritive functions of the body—alter them—promote the various secretions
and excretions—and thus resolve, purify, and re-organise the animal
machine.”<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> In addition to these effects (which an ordinary mortal might
be content with), the springs of Ragoczy and Pandur possess a strengthening
and tonic quality, in consequence of the iron which they contain.
The Soolensprudel, whether taken alone, or mixed with the Ragoczy, acts
briskly as an aperient. “In this combination of tonic with alterative
properties, the Kissengen waters (Ragoczy and Pandur), have no equals
in the spas of Germany.” “In all the other spas it is the solvent principle
(principe resolutif) which predominates—in these, the various principles
are united harmoniously.” The efficacy of these waters is greatly
increased by a series of baths of the same. The order of these baths is
ranged as follows:—the Maxbrunnen is gently exciting, and at the same
time tranquillizing—the Pandur is solvent and promotes the secretions—the
Ragoczy, alterative and tonic—the Soolensprudel profoundly penetrating
and strongly solvent. The sensible effects of these baths are of a refreshing,
animating nature—altering and bringing the functions of the
skin into a normal or healthy condition, and establishing the harmony between
the cutaneous surface, and the various organs and membranes of
the interior—thereby dispersing disorders of those parts. To these effects
Dr. Balling adds those which result from the absorption of the finer and
more soluble ingredients of the waters, which pervade all the organs and
tissues through the medium of the circulation. The doctor asks, where
are to be found such baths as these, containing such various minerals,
and so easy of combination, as to meet every variety of malady?</p>

<p>“These mineral waters (internally and externally) applied to the surface—taken
into the circulation—or digested in the stomach or duodenum, oppose
themselves, in the living organism, to morbific matters—afterwards exciting
and assisting nature to expel these morbid principles from the body. <i>In
this case an irritation, a re-action is established throughout the whole constitution,
converting chronic diseases into those of a greater or less degree of
acuteness, accompanied by febrile symptoms.</i> This fever assumes a septenary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
type, lasting, sometimes one week, sometimes two. In this stage
<i>it requires the greatest care on the part of the patient, and the greatest
vigilance and skill on the part of the physician, to manage this febrile period,
so as not to let it run too high, nor yet to fall short of the salutary range</i>.
It is only in this stage, that the diseased organism perceives its malady—and
it is absolutely necessary that the patient should feel ill, if he hopes to
recover his health.”<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Balling is perfectly right when he says that this febrile re-action
requires the greatest skill and care. But is it not evident that among the
shoals of patients who take the waters of Kissengen, or any other waters
of the kind, several must experience danger, and some even fatal effects,
from this re-action? We may be sure that the late Duke of Nassau had the
best advice at Kissengen, and yet he lost his life by the warm bath there!</p>

<p>The waters of Kissengen are recommended by our author with dietetic
and prophylactic intentions, to prevent diseases and correct a disposition
to them, as well as to remove them when fully developed.</p>

<p>The waters of Maxbrunnen are excellent means for preserving the
constitution from dispositions, or, as they are termed, predispositions to
diseases, arising from original taint, or following attacks of acute inflammatory
complaints.</p>

<p>The waters of the Maxbrunnen internally, and of the Pandur in baths,
have been used for many years <i>dietetically</i> as preventive of scrofula, in
those whose parents had been strumous, or who themselves shewed a tendency
to it—and also of affections of the mucous membrane of the chest,
and also of the abdomen. They are used habitually against disposition to
venous congestion of the abdominal viscera, the prolific source of gout,
hypochondriasis, hæmorrhoids, cutaneous eruptions. Among the chief
symptoms of the abdominal plethora, Dr. B. adduces acidity, disagreeable
taste in the mouth, uneasy digestion, tension and fulness of the hypochondria,
sense of oppression at the chest, turbid urine, irregular bowels,
constipation, dry skin, or malodorous perspirations, eruptions on the surface,
&amp;c. For these symptoms the Ragoczy and Pandur are reckoned
heroic remedies.</p>

<p>Among the maladies actually developed, or developing themselves, Dr.
B. has arranged the following, with short remarks on each, as being peculiarly
under the influence of the waters of Kissengen.</p>

<p>1. <i>Catarrhal affections</i> of the mucous membrane of the chest, so far advanced
as to be threatening phthisis, have been cured or greatly benefitted
by the waters of this spa. They are said to be equally efficacious in affections
of the mucous membrane of the kidneys, bladder, and uterine system,
as well as of the alimentary canal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <i>Rheumatic complaints.</i>—Great numbers of patients afflicted with the
large tribe of rheumatic affections, resort annually to Kissengen for relief,
and, as is asserted, with remarkable success.</p>

<p>3. <i>Scrofula</i>, developed, as well as brooding in the constitution—now so
universally diffused among society—has, in the waters of Kissengen, a
powerful remedy—more especially enlargement of the mesenteric glands,
tubercles of the lungs, &amp;c. Many unmarried females present a complication
of scrofulous and nervous symptoms, indicated by enlargement of the
mesenteric glands, pains and tenderness of the abdomen, hysteria, irregular
menstruation, and numerous symptoms of disordered digestion. These
are much benefitted, if not cured, by the Kissengen waters.</p>

<p>4. <i>Hæmorrhoidal affections.</i>—The Ragoczy and Pandur are famous in
these complaints, so prevalent on the Continent, and regarded with so
much importance there. It will be a sufficient specimen of German pathology
on this point, to remark that the very enlightened physician whose
work I am quoting, looks upon latent piles as indicated by the following
symptoms: viz.—head-aches—perspirations—pain in the spleen—cutaneous
eruptions—vertigo—diarrhœa—asthma—blennorhagia—ovarian tumors—weakness
of sight—spectral images before the eyes—vomiting of
blood—swellings of the liver, uterus, &amp;c.—discharges of blood from the
kidneys, bowels, &amp;c. “In all these masked forms of hæmorrhoids, the
waters of Kissengen are more or less beneficial.” p. 49.</p>

<p>5. <i>Gouty affections.</i>—Where gout wanders about, and annoys the internal
organs, the waters of this spa are asserted to be of great efficacy.</p>

<p>6. <i>Cutaneous eruptions.</i>—These are looked upon as only external signs
of internal affections—especially of disorder in the abdominal viscera, for
which the Kissengen spas are almost specific.</p>

<p>7. <i>Hypochondriasis.</i>—The vast number of hypochondriacs who annually
resort to Kissengen, are, Dr. B. thinks, incontestible proofs of the
good effects of the waters. Considering that hypochondriacs run every
where, and seldom get cured, this proof is rather equivocal.</p>

<p>8. <i>Hysteria</i>, in all its various forms.—9. Melancholia.—10. Asthma—when
dependent on abdominal affections.</p>

<p>11. <i>Stomach complaints.</i>—12. Affections of the bowels.—13. Ovarian
and uterine diseases.—14. Neuralgic affections, tic douloureux, &amp;c.—15.
Debility.—16. Various complaints following acute diseases, as fevers, inflammations,
&amp;c.</p>

<h4>PHYSICAL EFFECTS AND MEDICINAL PROPERTIES OF THE DIFFERENT
SPRINGS.</h4>

<p>1. <i>Maxbrunnen.</i>—This water, when taken early in the morning, causes
a certain degree of irritation in the fauces and nose, that leads to slight
cough or sneezing, succeeded by a sensation of heat in the stomach, and
not unfrequently by some confusion or giddiness in the head, as if from
wine. These phenomena are speedily followed by a comfortable feeling,
refreshment, and agility. After a few glasses of the water are drunk, the
secretion from the kidneys is augmented considerably, followed by perspiration—and
ultimately by some action on the bowels. This last effect,
however, does not generally take place till after the waters have been used
for a few days. The mucous secretion, however, both from the bowels
and air-tubes is always increased—especially if there had been previously
any tracheal or bronchial affection. This spring is found to be most beneficial
to people of bilious, phlegmatic, and plethoric temperaments. People
who shew a decided disposition to catarrhal affections, or inflammation of
the mucous membrane of the lungs, will do well to mix the Maxbrunnen
water with an equal quantity of whey. Scrofula, chronic bronchitis, indigestion,
and other affections, are benefitted by these waters.</p>

<p>2. <i>Ragoczy.</i>—A glass of this water taken fasting, causes a refreshing
warmth in the stomach, followed by some degree of distention, with slight
eructations of gas. The head next becomes affected, with a sense of
pressure in the front, and even some degree of giddiness. If sufficient
exercise be taken between each glass, a gentle perspiration occurs—the
kidneys act more freely—and phlegm is expectorated from the mucous
membrane of the air-passages. All these symptoms are generally followed
by two or three actions on the bowels. This cycle of phenomena occupies
from two to four hours, when the symptoms all subside, and the
patient feels comfortable during the remainder of the day. These phenomena
continue for some days—and as the appetite augments, it is too
often indulged freely, with inconvenience. At the end of a few days, all
the functions of the body, but especially the mucous secretions, take on a
considerable degree of activity—and the secretions themselves become
changed in quality as well as quantity. From the end of the first week
till the end of the second, the general state of health is much altered, in
consequence of the excited condition of the whole organism, which is
now roused into action against the malady. “The patient becomes
irascible, capricious, discontented;—the waters no longer render him comfortable,
brisk, or increase his appetite:—on the contrary, the tongue
begins to be furred, the appetite to fail, the secretions to become irregular
and morbid, not only from the bowels, but from the other mucous
membranes, and even the skin, which often exhales a peculiar acidulous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
odour.” The urinary secretion gets thick and sedimentary, with a predominance
of acid or alkali, and a scum over its surface. If the liver or
spleen were affected, they now become softer, and the abdomen is sensible
to pressure. The same is observed in the other abdominal and pelvic
organs when previously affected. In short, when the patient begins to
think that the waters are disagreeing with him, and making him ill, the
Doctor is of a very different opinion, viewing this re-action as a salutary
effort of Nature, assisted by the waters, to expel the morbific matter or
cause of disease from the system.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>3. <i>The Pandur.</i>—The physical effects of this spring are nearly the same
as those of the Ragoczy. It acts a little more strongly on the kidneys,
skin, and bowels. On this last account it is a most useful spring in all
abdominal congestions, torpid bowels, and sluggish liver. On the same
account also (its aperient qualities) it causes less of the re-action described
above, affects the head much less than the Ragoczy, and also the
chest. The effects of the Pandur, when taken in the evening, are worthy
of notice. If two or three glasses are taken in the evening, it has a
calming, tranquillizing effect on the whole system—promotes sleep—or
produces it if the individual were previously wakeful. At the same time
it promotes perspiration, and secretion from the kidneys; but does not act
on the bowels—unless a large quantity be taken. About eight or nine in
the morning, however, it opens the bowels comfortably, especially if
assisted by a few morning glasses of the same water. In this respect it
differs greatly from the Ragoczy—which cannot be taken in the evening.
It is also an important auxiliary to the Ragoczy. The Pandur is preferable
to the Ragoczy in all cases where an alterative, solvent, and aperient
effect is more desirable than a tonic. It is fitter for young females
affected with abdominal and uterine plethora—or indeed plethora of any
part, than the neighbouring spring. It is also more profitable in nervous,
irritable habits than the other. Where constipation obtains, it is peculiarly
useful.</p>

<p>4. <i>Soolensprudel.</i>—It is only about two years (before March 1839) that
this water has been used internally. It is strongly purgative and solvent.
Two or three glasses taken fasting, are sure to produce one, or even several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
evacuations from the bowels, without griping or inconvenience. Although
there is a very small quantity of iron in the Soolensprudel, yet, in combination
with the carbonic acid gas, it does not weaken the digestive
organs, so much as some other waters of the saline kind. It may be
given, as an aperient, in all cases where the Ragoczy and Pandur are
proper.</p>

<h4>THE BATHS.</h4>

<p>The effects of all the Kissengen waters, when used as baths, have a considerable
resemblance to each other. The plus or minus of carbonic acid
gas, and of iron, make the chief differences. As the baths have hardly
ever been employed without the internal use of the waters, their effects
cannot be positively ascertained as under other circumstances. The general
phenomena, however, may be stated as follows:—</p>

<p>The patient feels soothed, refreshed, and even strengthened, by the first
few baths; but about the seventh day, the symptoms of re-action commence,
and then the pleasing sensations of the bath disappear—and he feels
enfeebled and uncomfortable after leaving the water. These phenomena
increase. The skin becomes relaxed—slightly reddened, and copious
perspirations break out—or if not, the kidneys act vigorously. If there
be any cutaneous eruptions, they increase, become inflamed, and discharge
freely. Rheumatic and gouty pains are exasperated, and sometimes carried
into a state of acute inflammation, with fever, which lasts three or four
days, and then disappears. In such cases, the baths must be discontinued
for a short time. In general, most of the diseases which are ultimately
cured by the baths and waters, are, for a certain period, rendered
worse. In the course, or rather towards the end of this re-action, certain
critical evacuations take place, more especially from the skin, accompanied
by a peculiar odour—or boils or other eruptions break forth—or depositions
take place in the urine, sometimes even of blood—or by the bowels. This
crisis past, a state of amelioration takes place, and now the baths should
be discontinued, not at once, but gradually.</p>

<p>The morbid conditions which require the baths <i>more</i> than the drinking
of the waters are—chronic affections of the skin—rheumatic and gouty
complaints, whether external or internal—neuralgic affections—complaints
driven from the surface to the interior.</p>

<p>We need not dwell on the slight differences which take place in the use
of the baths of the Maxbrunnen, Pandur, and Ragoczy. The baths of
the Soolensprudel deserve a remark or two. The baths of this source are
more powerful than those of the others, often producing considerable heat
and irritation of the skin, accompanied by corresponding re-action of the
system generally—even to fever, which requires marked and vigilant attention,
otherwise very serious consequences may result. At the same time,
it may be observed that the baths of the Soolensprudel are less disposed
to affect the head and the chest, than other baths of weaker powers, if used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
with caution. They have hitherto been chiefly employed in cases of
confirmed scrofula, both external and internal—in uterine and ovarian
affections—in inveterate rheumatic and gouty complaints.</p>

<p>In the after-cure, the waters of Bocklet and Bruckenau, chalybeates
both, are almost essential, to restore the strength, after the alterative and
aperient waters of Kissengen, and after the struggle which the constitution
has had with the malady.</p>

<p>1. <i>Season.</i>—Dr. Balling conceives that different complaints require
different periods of the season for their removal by the waters of Kissengen.
In general, however, the time is from the middle of Spring till the
end of Autumn.</p>

<p>2. <i>Preparation.</i>—Dr. B. gives us some advice on this point, which we
can seldom follow—namely, to dismiss all care, before we visit Kissengen!—to
bring with us a statement of our case from the physician in ordinary—to
bring warm clothing, adapted to Winter as well as Summer—not to
bring unnecessary family and servants—to travel leisurely from home to
Kissengen—to rest a few days after the journey, before the waters or baths
are taken, and consult with the physician of the place.</p>

<p>3. <i>Mode of taking the waters.</i>—The time is from six till eight o’clock
in the morning. The quantity of the waters taken must depend on the
capability of the stomach to digest them. As there is much carbonic acid
gas in the waters, they ought to be drunk quickly, each portion. The
Ragoczy and Pandur are generally taken cold; but, in particular cases,
the chill may be taken off them. Ten or twelve minutes should intervene
between each goblet of the waters. The first glasses are more easily digested
than the later ones. Easy walking between the glasses is beneficial.
All persons disposed to congestions about the head or chest, as
evinced by giddiness, or oppression in the act of breathing, should be very
cautious and moderate in the use of these waters. In the period of re-action,
the symptoms should be marked by the patient and communicated
to the physician. Breakfast may be taken in half an hour after the last
goblet of water. If the waters are taken in the evening, it should be four
or five hours after dinner. These regulations apply chiefly to the Ragoczy
and Pandur. The Maxbrunnen spring is generally drunk with a moderate
proportion of whey or milk.</p>

<h4>THE BATHS.</h4>

<p>The waters of the Maxbrunnen remain clear when heated. The others
become a little turbid by the heat. Patients are recommended not to bathe
in any of these waters for three or four days after their arrival. They
should be taken for some days internally, before the baths are used, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
order that the bowels may be free, and the secretions improved. They
ought to be employed to the point of saturation—which generally takes
place in a shorter time than by the drinking of the waters. The baths
are taken before noon, and after drinking the waters, before breakfast—or
in the evening. The baths, however, may be taken two hours after a light
breakfast—and are more agreeable to most people at this time than before
the repast. Once a day is often enough. They are generally raised to
96° or 98° of Fahrenheit—and half an hour is the usual period of immersion.
It is prudent not to stay in more than ten or fifteen minutes at
first, and to gradually increase the period, till it comes to thirty or forty
minutes.</p>

<p>“Patients who are disposed to convulsions, vertigo, faintings, or fulness
about the head, should not use these baths but with extreme caution.
Such people ought to keep the head covered with cloths wet with cold
water during immersion.”<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> These baths are absolutely prejudicial, if the
patient goes in when heated, perspiring, or excited by passions of the mind.
The bather ought not to plunge at once into the bath, but first to sponge
the chest and stomach with the warm water. It is hurtful to read in the
bath, and more so, to go to sleep. On the contrary, the bather should
keep in constant motion, to use friction with his own hands over the chest
and abdomen. “If, during immersion, the patient be seized with feverish
heat, chilliness, shivering, head-ache, oppression on the chest—or any kind
of malaise, he should immediately quit the bath, and examine whether or
not the temperature has been too high or too low. He should dress himself
quickly on leaving the bath, and take some turns in the dressing-room
before going into the open air. Gentle exercise after the bath is very
beneficial.”</p>

<p>The point of saturation from the baths is considered by Dr. Balling as
a matter of great importance. This point is not attained till the morbific
matters are expelled from the constitution, and all the secretions have become
healthy and natural—especially those from the intestinal canal. The
time necessary for attaining this desirable condition will be different in
different constitutions—and in different diseases. Generally speaking, it
requires two weeks of the bath. After this period the patient and physician
should be on their guard, and watch well the phenomena as they
occur.</p>

<p>The effects of these waters on the human organism do not cease when
the drinking and bathing are left off. They often continue for a long
time, and complete the cure which was left incomplete at the spa. It but
too frequently happens that, when patients experience no relief at medicinal
spas, they are told to hope for a cure from the <i>consecutive</i> effects of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the waters. They are often disappointed. In respect to the Kissengen
springs, we are informed by Dr. Balling, that unless they produce the
<i>reaction</i> already described, during the time the patient is using them, no
<i>consecutive</i> effects are to be expected. But, on the other hand, if the reaction
clearly shews itself at the springs, considerable consecutive effects,
of a salutary nature, may be confidently looked for—and the remainder
of the cure may be safely trusted to nature at the patient’s own home.
The system of diet enjoined by the Kissengen physicians, and Dr. Balling
in particular, is nearly as rigid as at most of the other spas, where certain
doctors have hobbies which they ride to death beyond the Rhine as well
as in this country.</p>

<h4>ORDER OF THE DAY.</h4>

<p>At six o’clock in the morning the band marches and plays through the
middle of the town to the garden, summoning the sick to their morning
potations. “It is here,” says Dr. B. “that a most curious scene presents
itself to the musing eye. Eight hundred or a thousand invalids (for comparatively
few others go to Kissengen) are quickly assembled in the walks
of the “<span class="smcap">Jardin de cure</span>,” of all conditions and ages—the prince by the
side of the tradesman—the queen by that of the peasant girl—all having
but one object in view, the recovery of health. Nothing can be more interesting
than the general physiognomy which characterises the whole
moving mass of human beings.</p>

<p>The great spas present a morbid physiognomy each peculiar to itself.
Carlsbad exhibits the yellow and earthy—Ems the pallid and hectic—Pyrmont,
the pale chlorosis—the “green and yellow melancholy” of the
love-sick maiden. Kissengen has its peculiar physiognomy—but it is a
deceitful one—a countenance of morbid fulness and floridness, little indicative
of the grave maladies which lie concealed.”</p>

<p>This garden is of considerable extent, and contains numerous walks.
Those who like to be in the crowd may find their wishes satisfied in the
middle alleys—those who are fond of solitude, may indulge their meditations
in the remote paths. Those who are fond of comparing notes
with their brother and sister sufferers, have ample means of doing so, in
this asylum of valetudinarians.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock all disperse to their breakfasts; after which they either
repose for an hour or two, or take some walking exercise. At eleven
o’clock, the bathing process commences, after which another promenade or
repose—and then the one o’clock dinner. After dinner, and perhaps a
cup of coffee, the promenades in the garden, and the excursions into the
country are made. In the evening, the garden, the conversation-halls,
theatre, and gambling-tables, are the great places of resort.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall conclude with the following remark of Dr. Balling.</p>

<p>“In speaking of the gaming-tables of the Kurhaus, which are open from
three till ten o’clock every afternoon, it is to assert, in the most positive
manner, that all such games are eminently injurious to invalids, and greatly
obstruct the cure of their complaints. This is the case whether the individual
wins or loses money. In the state of excitement, almost febrile,
produced by the waters themselves and the re-action of the constitution,
the valetudinarian runs the risk of some dangerous perturbation in the
animal organism, which may cost him his life, and, at all events, must interrupt
the salutary operation of the springs.”</p>

<p>P.S.—On visiting these waters in August, 1840, I found that the
number of English invalids had somewhat decreased during that season.
The reputation of the waters, however, is evidently on the increase. I
saw several English who had experienced considerable benefit in stomach
complaints; whilst others complained much of the bad effects of the
waters on the head and nervous system. They are powerful waters, and
require attention. The spa doctors of Kissengen now enjoin a most rigid
system of diet, which greatly aids the medicinal effects of the waters. No
wine is allowed. The food is confined to soup and a little meat, without
any pudding, fruit, vegetables, or made dishes of any description! This
dietary, with early hours and plenty of water, must go a good way to
insure restoration of health, independently of the medicinal ingredients in
the springs.</p>

<h3 id="BOCKLET">BOCKLET.</h3>

<p>When the waters of Carlsbad or Kissengen have washed away the superfluous
green fat and ill-assimilated roast-beef from the body of <span class="smcap">John
Bull</span>—the sour krout and rancid sausages from the <span class="smcap">German</span>—and the
caviare and train oil from the <span class="smcap">Russ</span>—then these worthy personages repair
to <span class="smcap">Bocklet</span> or <span class="smcap">Bruckenau</span>, to undergo a very different process from that
of depuration—namely, to have their ribs lined with steel, and their stomachs
converted into gizzards. According to my information, those who
come to these acidulous chalybeate springs with digestive organs in a state
analogous to that of blotting-paper, go away from them, with the same
organs in a condition very closely resembling well tanned sole-leather!</p>

<p>The visitors of Carlsbad and Kissengen, are all radical reformers, tearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
up by the roots the numerous vices and abuses that have crept into their
constitutions;—but at Bocklet and Bruckenau, they become eminently
conservative—carefully rebuilding the various dilapidated portions of the
body corporate in the firmest manner, and on the most durable foundations.</p>

<p>Bocklet is only half-a-dozen miles from Kissengen, and the waters contain
little more than two-thirds of a grain of iron to the pint; but then there
are 31 cubic inches of free carbonic acid gas, which confer on the iron
the greatest possible state of solution, and consequently the greatest degree
of energetic action on the human frame. In the pint of this water, also,
there are 27 grains of muriate of soda—six grains of sulphate of soda—seven
grains of carbonate of lime—nearly two grains of carbonate of magnesia,
with some slight saline impregnations, of no great importance. The
whole of the solid contents are between 40 and 50 grains in the pint.
These ingredients, however, gently modify the action of the iron, and
render the water much safer, in many complaints and constitutions, than
the purer chalybeates (as for instance Bruckenau) where the astringency
and stimulation of the steel are unmitigated by saline counter-poises. Dr.
Hans, the Apollo of Bocklet, is loud in the praises of these waters, taken
internally and used as baths—and indeed, from their composition and their
physiological action, I think it probable that they are of greater utility,
and applicable to a wider range of diseases than any other chalybeate in
Germany, or perhaps in Europe.</p>

<p>At no spa do the applicants live more completely <i>en famille</i> than here—all
dining, drinking, and promenading together, sans ceremonie.</p>

<p>The cuisine at Bocklet appears to be under the superintendence of the
doctor. We dined at the one o’clock table-d’hôte, and had nothing but
soup—some bouilli—and roast chicken, instead of the endless courses at
other table-d’hôtes. The whole, with a pint bottle of wine, cost about
eighteen-pence for each person! Bocklet, however, seems but little frequented,
compared with Bruckenau, though its waters are of an excellent
quality. The drive from Kissengen along the side of the Saal, is very
pleasant, and passes the Soolensprudel and salt works, which we stopped
to examine. The Soolensprudel was in high feather, foaming and boiling
over into conduits that conveyed it to the baths. It is well worth
seeing.</p>

<p>There are some pleasant excursions in the neighbourhood, where time
may be killed, and health promoted by the same process.</p>

<p>The air for a mile or two around the salines strongly resembles sea air,
where there is much sea-weed on the shore. It is very grateful and
refreshing.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="BRUCKENAU">BRUCKENAU.</h3>

<p>At the distance of sixteen miles from Kissengen, a route requiring five
hours and a half, with strong horses, over a road which is by no means
abundant in good scenery, but exuberant of steep hills and rough causeways,
lies <span class="smcap">Bruckenau</span>, between two lofty and wooded hills, in the pretty
but certainly not romantic valley of the <span class="smcap">Sinn</span>—a chalybeate much frequented,
even by royalty—the King of Bavaria having a residence there
for taking the waters in the spa-season. There are three or four springs—two,
the Sinnberger and Wernarzer, close together, on the left bank of
the river—resembling tolerable, and only tolerable, soda-water, in taste,
having scarcely any savour of steel—and containing not more than a grain
of solid matters in the pint. The former of these is much used in calculous
complaints—scrofula—and chronic affections of the mucous membrane
of the lungs. Dr. Schipper affirms that the water of the Sinnberger
possesses a peculiar, or rather specific influence on the skin, in the
promotion of perspiration.</p>

<p>The Wernarzer is nearly the same in taste and composition; but is more
used in dyspeptic complaints, or morbid sensibility of the gastric and intestinal
nerves.</p>

<p>It is on crossing the little river Sinn, that we come to the lion of the
place—the <span class="smcap">Bruckenauer</span>, springing up under a large red pavilion, and
discharging its contents through four tiny wooden tubes, into a circular
basin, encrusted with the red oxide of iron. I saw none of the commotion
which Dr. Granville describes; on the contrary, the Bruckenauer is
one of the most quiet and placid wells which I have ever seen, considering
that the water contains 36 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas to the pint,
which ought to make it as frisky as Champagne. It is pleasant to the
taste; but not more so than the Weinbrunnen at Schwalbach—the Pouhon
at Spa—or the Pandur at Kissengen. In fact, I was greatly disappointed,
as far as taste is concerned, in the waters of Bruckenau, so
exaggerated are the accounts which have been published respecting their
ethereal, sparkling, exhilarating, piquant qualities.</p>

<p>The chalybeate nature of the Bruckenauer is unequivocally evinced by
the great deposition of iron on all parts of the basin in which it is contained—and
by the strong iron gout which it leaves in the mouth after
being swallowed. Although there is only a quarter of a grain of steel in
the pint, yet this mineral is at its maximum of oxidation, in consequence
of the great proportion of carbonic acid gas, and the <span class="smcap">Bruckenauer</span> is
therefore held to be the clearest and most pure chalybeate in the world.
The physiological effects of this spa are considered to be highly stimulating,
tonic, and astringent—augmenting the velocity of the circulation,
and the volume of the pulse—oxygenating the blood—giving tone to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
body, and colour to the lips and cheeks of the blanched female. In addition
to these valuable qualities, the Bruckenau waters are said to possess the
opposite ones—of tranquillizing (“arresting every symptom of irregular
mobility,”) of the nervous system. Now, if all the spa-doctors, between
Carlsbad in the East, and Saratoga in the West, combined to certify this
fact, I would remain sceptical. I will not maintain that such conflicting
qualities are incompatible with each other; but it would require very
weighty facts to induce me to believe that they co-exist in this pure chalybeate
spring.</p>

<p>Bruckenau is to Germany what Tonbridge Wells is to England. Although
the <i>latter</i> spa contains much more iron than the Continental one,
Bruckenau has greatly the advantage in the large proportion of carbonic
acid gas, rendering the German chalybeate infinitely more tonic than the
English.</p>

<p>The water of Bruckenau, then, like all pure tonics, is a powerful engine
in skilful hands; but a dangerous weapon when wielded without judgment.
Debility, or at least a feeling of debility, attends almost every
disease, whether acute or chronic. To remove this symptom is the constant
prayer of the patient, and the great embarrassment of the practitioner,
who knows that those remedies which augment the general strength,
too often increase the activity and danger of the local disorder. It must
be owned that in medicine, as well as in other professions, there are individuals
who, for the sake of ill-got fame and sordid pelf, will pander to
the appetites, prejudices, and ignorance of the public, and, through the
agency of food and physic, force, as it were, the general strength beyond
the level at which the local malady can be safely remedied. The fire
is smouldered but not extinguished, and is sure to break out, sooner or
later, with redoubled violence. But the object of the doctor is attained—the
fees are secure, and his skill is already attested by the deluded victim,
who is ashamed afterwards to recall the testimony. The attempt to restore
general health or strength by tonics or chalybeates, where there exists a
local disorder of any organ or structure, is not merely illusory, but
prejudicial or even dangerous. Hence the necessity of an accurate examination
of all the organs, before a course of tonics is entered on at
home, or a journey to a chalybeate spa abroad. Much expense, fatigue,
and disappointment would be saved by such a preliminary investigation.
It is in cases where the general health and strength are breaking down
under <i>functional disorder</i>, and where this disorder is corrected by other
spas or proper medicines, that the chalybeates of Spa, Schwalbach,
Bruckenau, or Bocklet, act like a charm in restoring energy to the constitution,
taken internally and used externally.</p>

<p>The chalybeate bath requires caution and attention, as well as the
drinking of the waters. Although much of the iron is lost by the escape
of the carbonic acid gas, still the corrugation, redness, and roughness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the skin produced by immersion in the chalybeate bath indicate a powerful
agency, and when lassitude, drowsiness, head-ache, or sense of exhaustion
follow the bath, the patient should be on his guard, and either
desist, or report to the bath physician.</p>

<p>There must be an especial freedom from all organic disease, and even
from functional disorder—especially disordered function of the liver or
digestive apparatus, attended with morbid secretions, where such a pure
and powerful chalybeate as Bruckenau can be safely employed.</p>

<p>The King of Bavaria has erected here a Cursaal apparently intended to
rival, or rather to eclipse its celebrated namesake of Wisbaden. It is a
structure of great height, dimensions, and decorations, surrounded on all
sides by a fine open colonnade, and presenting a noble portico. At the
table-d’hôte, of one o’clock, there sate down about eighty or a hundred
guests; but many of them were, no doubt, visitors from Kissengen. They
seemed to defy the rigid injunctions of the Kissengen doctors, and probably
considered that during the “<span class="smcap">Nach-Kur</span>” or after-cure, and while they
were lining their ribs with steel, they ought to have a commensurate latitude
in the enjoyments of the table.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 id="FRANZENSBAD">FRANZENSBAD.</h3>

<p>At the distance of three short miles from the town of Eger or Egra, in
Bohemia, lies Franzensbad, a spa of considerable reputation. The situation
is not very pleasant, being rather bare of wood and shade, and the surrounding
country by no means picturesque. The town, or village, in fact, is
in the midst of a great bog, and the houses, like those of Amsterdam and
Venice, are built on piles driven into the ground. Franzensbad is a colony
from Egra, and dates only from 1795. It took its name from the principal
source—<span class="smcap">Franzensquelle</span>. The houses are modern, clean, and cheerful—the
walks, though not yet sufficiently numerous or shaded, are in progress—and
the bazaars furnish all kinds of necessaries, and even luxuries,
to the spa-goers.</p>

<h4>I. FRANZENSQUELLE, OR BRUNN.</h4>

<p>This is the lion of the place, and is the first spring on which we stumble
on our way from Eger. Its name was formerly the Egra, and its waters,
which are now exported to every corner of the earth, still go by the name
of Eger water. It is supposed to have been known for eight hundred
years past. The spring is placed under a circular temple, from which the
bazaar colonnade stretches round two sides of a square. It sends forth
275 cubic inches of water per minute, at an invariable temperature of
about 49°. The water of this well is clear as crystal, and discharges great
numbers of bubbles of gas, which coat the sides of the glass. It is a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
time before it becomes turbid in the vessel. In the course of several days
it begins to be decomposed, and lets fall some particles of oxide of iron.
This spring is in continual agitation, emitting with some noise its carbonic
acid gas. It has no odour of any kind, and the taste is very pleasant,
piquant, and refreshing. The après-gout, or after taste is decidedly chalybeate.
Mixed with a fourth part of white wine and some sugar, the
Franzensquelle forms a remarkably agreeable beverage. If the sugar be
in fine powder, and briskly stirred about in the glass, the whole foams up
like Champagne.</p>

<p><i>Physiological properties.</i>—The Franzensquelle is considered by all the
best medical authorities on the subject, as at one and the same time, solvent,
strengthening, and stimulant. Its chief contents are as follows: in
a pint or pound of the water, there are 34 grains of solid matters, and 30½
cubic inches of carbonic acid gas. The chief ingredients are ¾ grain of
silex—6⅓ grs. bicarbonate of soda—one third of a grain of oxide of iron—1¼
grain of carbonate of lime—19 grains sulphate of soda—7 grains of
muriate of soda—in all 34 grains.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Although it contains one-third of a grain of steel, and that minutely
dissolved by means of the carbonic acid, yet the Franzensquelle may be
administered to people who are both irritable and debilitated, without any
danger of proving too heating or exciting.</p>

<p>Its internal use produces the following effects. 1. It acts on the
nervous system, which it strengthens, tranquillizes, and diminishes irritability.
2. On the muscular system it exerts a tonic effect. 3. On
the vascular system it produces an increase of activity—accelerates the
circulation—augments the red colour of the blood, as well as the animal
heat of the body. It also increases the functions of digestion, assimilation,
and nutrition. 4. It dissolves mucus in the bowels, expels worms,
and rarely produces constipation. On the venous circulation of the liver
it is believed to act in a very salutary manner—dissipating congestions in
that quarter. 5. On the uterine system it acts vigorously, proving both
tonic and stimulant. Hence it is much used by females of pale complexions,
watery blood, and various derangements peculiar to the sex. 6. The
water of this spring is diuretic, and beneficial to the kidneys, when their
function is disturbed. 7. It is asserted that the Franzensquelle is useful
in relaxed states of the mucous membrane of the trachea and bronchia.
The union of a solvent and tonic property is attributed not so much to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
combination of saline and chalybeate ingredients, as to their antagonism,
thus producing a new agent of specific powers. And here I consider it
better to take the opinion of the venerable Hufeland, on these waters, than
the assertions of the spa-doctors themselves. The following sentiments
were published by the celebrated Prussian physician in 1822.</p>

<p>“When I speak of the waters of Franzensbad, it is as of an old and
valued friend. The renown of these waters has continued ever since the
days of Hoffman, and I myself have witnessed many remarkable cures
effected by them. In 1820, I drew a parallel between the waters of
Franzensbad and those of the Kreutzbrunn, at Marienbad—all from personal
observation. It was long the custom in Berlin and other large
towns, for the merchants, men of letters, politicians, and, in fact, the
greater part of the bureaucracy, to tear themselves from their various occupations,
and take the waters of Franzensbad for a month. They almost
all laboured under a complication of functional disorders, as difficult and
painful digestion, constipation, deranged secretions, or gouty affections.
While taking the waters, they were separated from their offices—kept early
hours—lived temperately—and enjoyed exercise in the open air. The
effects were remarkable. They laid in a stock of health for the remainder
of the year—and thus prevented functional disorders from advancing into
changes of structure. Frederick the Great was one of those who profited
by the waters of Franzensbad. This illustrious monarch often became
a prey to the most miserable feelings and gloomy sentiments. In 1748,
this state amounted to a high degree, aggravated by a tertian fever and
various gouty affections. At this period the king considered that his days
were numbered, and that his last ones were at hand. His physician prevailed
on him to try the waters of Egra (Franzensbad), where he completely
recovered his health, and lived to an advanced old age.”</p>

<p>“Although the waters of Franzensbad belong to the chalybeate class,
their properties are quite peculiar. They are very ethereal, and combine
so much saline matters with the iron, that they are penetrating, easy of
digestion, tonic, exciting, animating without heating, solvent of obstructions,
aperient, and favourable to the promotion of healthy secretions and
excretions. These waters are incomparable when the object is to purge
without debilitating—to increase the activity of the blood-vessels without
heating or producing congestion—to strengthen without constipating. It
follows from this, that there are few chronic maladies for which these waters
are not an effectual remedy—and few persons who will not bear their
operation well.</p>

<p>“I shall now briefly allude to the principal complaints to which the
waters of Franzensbad are particularly applicable.</p>

<p>“In the first rank stands <span class="smcap">Hypochondriasis</span>, especially if accompanied
by atony of the bowels, congestion of the abdominal vessels, constipation,
hæmorrhoidal tendency, or determination of blood to any of the vital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
organs. In such cases <i>pure</i> chalybeates would only augment the evil;
whereas the saline chalybeates are of the greatest benefit. Chronic nervous
affections, with or without cramps or spasms of stomach and bowels,
are a class that derive great advantage from these waters. The same may be
said of all chronic disorders, the sequel of long-continued indigestion, with
flatulence, acidities, and eructations. Hæmorrhoids, whether fluent or dry,
are ameliorated or removed by the waters of Franzensbad. They are almost
specific in biliary derangements, from torpid liver up to actual jaundice.
Finally, in reverting to the case of Frederick the Great, I can aver that,
for the long catalogue of human afflictions, the consequences of sedentary
lives, full living, anxieties of mind, and crowded cities, the waters of
Franzensbad are inimitable—even if only taken for a month each season.
I have frequently ordered them, and with great advantage, in affections of
the mucous membranes of the chest—and even where there were strong
indications of tubercles in the lungs. In these last cases, however, it will
be prudent to exhibit them in combination with warm milk—especially
asses milk. In chronic affections of the kidneys and bladder—in gravel
and calculus, I have given the waters with benefit. These waters are not
injured by time or carriage.”</p>

<p>Such are the sentiments of the celebrated Hufeland, and I have preferred
them to the statements of the spa doctors themselves, for very obvious
reasons.</p>

<h4>II. THE SALZQUELLE.</h4>

<p>This spring is situated in a turfy meadow a few hundred yards to the
eastward of the Franzensbrunn, at the end of a long colonnade. It is
defended from the rain by a circular dome. It throws up 133 cubic inches
of water per minute. It is perfectly clear, and disengages much carbonic
acid gas. It takes a good while to become decomposed, when it throws
down some whitish flakes, but no oxide of iron. It has no odour, and
the taste is brisk and refreshing, rather alkaline, but not in the least
chalybeate.</p>

<p><i>Contents.</i>-¼ grain of silex—7 grs. of bicarbonate of soda—a mere trace
of iron—1½ gr. carbonate of lime—13½ grs. sulphate of soda—7 grs. of
muriate of soda—total about 30 grains, with 20 cubic inches of carbonic
acid gas in the pint.</p>

<p>From the above analysis it is evident that the <span class="smcap">Salzquelle</span> differs not
essentially from the Franzensbrunn, except in the iron, which is infinitely
greater in quantity in the latter than in the former. The Salzquelle bears
considerable analogy to the waters of Carlsbad and Marienbad. It is
equally penetrating, solvent, and easy of digestion as the Franzensquelle,
but less irritating, and more refreshing. Weak people, and those who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
disposed to congestions of blood, bear this spring better than its chalybeate
neighbour. Hufeland, in 1823, published the following opinion.</p>

<p>“Franzensbad has gained much by the discovery of the saline (Salzquelle)
spring. I am acquainted with all the German spas, and have no
hesitation in stating that this source is quite peculiar in its nature, and
hitherto inscrutable. The physiological action of this spring is equally
mild and penetrating, promoting the secretions rather than the evacuations.
The waters of this source are more easily borne than those of the
chalybeate.”</p>

<h4>III. THE COLD SPRUDEL.</h4>

<p>This is a small circular well, close to another very large and oval one,
both of which are at a short distance behind the bazaar colonnade. This
water is in continual motion, like its more celebrated namesake at Carlsbad;
but does not leap so high, and is quite cold. It furnishes 3648 cubic
inches of water per minute. When poured into a glass it is clear and
effervescent. The taste is agreeable, refreshing, and slightly chalybeate.
It has no flavour; the quantity of carbonic acid gas which it disengages
while drinking, often causes sneezing.</p>

<p><i>Contents.</i>—6⅓ grs. bicarb, soda—⅒ gr. of oxide of iron—1¼ gr. carb.
lime—20 grs. sulphate of soda—6½ muriate of soda—total 33½ grs. in
the pint, with about 30 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas.</p>

<p>From the above analysis it appears that the Cold Sprudel holds a place,
both chemically and medicinally, intermediate between the Franzensquelle
and the Salzquelle. It is more solvent and aperient than the <i>former</i>—but
more exciting and irritating than the <i>latter</i>. It is unnecessary to go into
details as to the cases in which the one source is preferable to the other.
A combination or alternation of the two will often be more beneficial than
an exclusive use of either.</p>

<h4>IV. LOUISENBRUNN.</h4>

<p>Close to the Sprudel, and under the same canopy, boils up in prodigious
quantities, the Louisenquelle. The basin is of a large oval form, and contains
several springs within itself. It disgorges 27,056 cubic inches of
water per minute! It is in perpetual agitation, like its neighbour the
Sprudel, and serves exclusively for bathing. The carbonic acid gas boils
up in large and innumerable bubbles, with considerable noise. It appears
turbid in the basin, but is perfectly clear in a glass. The taste is quite as
pleasant as that of the Franzensquelle, but without the after-taste of ink
produced by the latter source.</p>

<p><i>Contents.</i>—⅑th of a grain of silex—4 grs. of bicarbonate of soda-¼ of
a gr. of carbonate of iron—1¼ gr. carb. lime—16 grs. sulphate of soda—5<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
grs. muriate of soda—total 27 grains, with 24½ cubic inches of carbonic
acid gas in the pint. It may be stated that the waters of Franzensbad
are used externally as baths—cold, tepid, or warm, in all the diseases and
disorders for which the same waters are used internally.</p>

<p>P. S.—Since the above was written I have received the following information
from a most talented pupil of St. George’s Hospital (Mr. <span class="smcap">Spitta</span>),
respecting a new source which had not been quite in operation when I
visited Franzensbad.</p>

<p>“One source yet remains to be noticed, of recent date truly, but still
by no means to be overlooked—the Weisenquelle, or Source de la Prairie.
It is situated still further eastward of the Franzensquelle than the Salzquelle;
and is principally remarkable for containing a small quantity of
sulphur in the form of sulphuretted hydrogen gas.</p>

<p>Drs. Kœstler and Palliardi have each published a small paper on its
virtues.</p>

<p>It contains the most salt of any of the wells at Franzensbad. In sixteen
ounces there are 25.6554 grains of sulphate of soda—9.3254 of
chloride of sodium—8.9787 of bicarbonate of soda—besides carbonates
of lime, magnesia, iron, (.1780 gr.) magnesia, stronthian and lithion,
phosphate of lime, subphosphate of alumina, and silica, each in small
quantities; together with .0588 of a peculiar salt termed by Zembsch the
analyst, “quellsaures eisenoxydul,” or oxide of iron in combination with
an acid peculiar to this well—making in all 46.6903 grains of saline
matter.</p>

<p>This source gives off a great quantity of carbonic acid, and when you
approach it the well-known odour of sulphuretted hydrogen is immediately
recognised.</p>

<p>According to the same chemist, Zembsch, 16 ounces contain 30.691
grs. of free carbonic acid, and .162 gr. of sulphuretted hydrogen. Its
medicinal properties are like the other springs, aperient and antacid, but
from its containing so much salt, and so little iron, it forms a sort of intermediate
spring between the Salzquelle, which has the merest trace, and
the Franzensquelle, which contains about one third of a grain of that
metal in the pint.</p>

<p>It is not so much employed as the other springs; so that its specific
effects dependent on the sulphur it contains have not as yet been very distinctly
observed.”</p>

<h4>GAS BATHS.</h4>

<p>These and the Mud-baths to be presently described, are becoming very
fashionable in Germany. From every inch of surface in the peat bog
around Franzensbad, carbonic acid gas is constantly issuing forth in such
quantities that its extrication is audible and visible, wherever there is water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
on the ground. To have a reservoir of this gas, it is only necessary to
build a house, and prevent the carbonic acid from being dispersed in the
air. It is there collected, and baths and douches are constructed for its
ready application to the body generally, or to any particular part thereof.
The Gas-bath or building at Franzensbad, stands within thirty or forty
yards of the Franzensquelle, and from the ground of this house, which is
of very moderate extent, there issues 5760 cubic <i>feet</i> of gas every twenty-four
hours!! There is little doubt that the extrication of carbonic acid is
equally plentiful in any and every part of the bog in which the town is
situated. I should think that to go to sleep on the ground, in a calm
Summer’s night, would be inevitable death. As it is, the good people of
Franzensbad, inhabitants and visitors, must be perpetually inhaling an atmosphere
well impregnated with this gas. I do not suppose, however, that
this is productive of any injurious effects.</p>

<p>The gas is conveyed into the bath through a cock at the bottom, and
the patient, being either dressed or undressed, sits down on a little stool,
while a wooden lid or cover, with a hole that fits tolerably close to the
neck, is placed over the body, the head being in the open air. They have
small tubes through which they can apply the gas to the eyes, ears, or any
part of the body, in a stream, the velocity of which can be augmented or
diminished at pleasure. They can also diminish the intensity of the gas
by applying a piece of muslin or taffeta over the pipe, or over the eyes or
ears that are subjected to the stream. I did not try the gas baths here,
but at Marienbad I used them generally and locally, accompanied by my
kind friend Dr. Herzig of that place. Standing in the bath, the cock was
turned without my being aware of it, and, in a few seconds, I felt a sense of
heat ascending quickly along my legs towards the body. Without thinking
of the gas I stooped, and put my head down towards the aperture of
the tube, by which I inhaled as much of the carbonic acid as caused a
sudden faintness. Dr. H. and the bathman quickly extricated me from
my perilous situation, and I went on with the bath, while my head was in
the open air. I found that the following representation of the sensible,
and physiological effects of the bath, as given by Baron Aimé, is sufficiently
correct. 1. The gas excites and even irritates the skin, producing a
pricking, and soon afterwards a strong itching on the surface, accompanied
by heat, and ultimately perspiration. 2. The gas stimulates the nerves
of all parts to which it is applied. I had a stream directed on my eyes,
which caused a most profuse flow of tears, with strong sense of heat.
When it was applied to my ears, a sense of heat, and a considerable noise
were the effects produced.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> 3. It is asserted by physicians of the Continent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
that this gas is extremely useful when applied to old, ill-conditioned,
and irritable ulcers, as soothing and promotive of healthy discharge, and
ultimately of cicatrisation. 4. Although the breathing of this gas is as
mortal as that of the Grotto de Cane, yet if diluted with plenty of atmospheric
air, it is thought that it might prove serviceable in some states or
stages of phthisis, asthma, &amp;c. 5. The action of this gas on the eyes and
ears I have already mentioned. Its remedial agency is much extolled in
certain disorders or diseases of those organs, attended with atony or morbid
irritability of their nerves and structures. 6. These baths are chiefly
employed in cases of paralysis attended with stiffness, feebleness, or spasmodic
movements. 7. In chronic, inveterate affections of a gouty or
rheumatic nature—chronic sores—glandular swellings—and various cutaneous
complaints, the gas baths are applied, and, as is affirmed, with success.
8. In uterine affections, irregularities, &amp;c. attended with torpor,
debility, and irritability.</p>

<p>Upon the whole I am disposed to think that the gas baths are active
agents, and that they may be made useful ones, when carefully applied.</p>

<h4>MUD BATHS.</h4>

<p>Among the novelties—transcendentalisms, or, as some would call them,
extravaganzas, of Germany, the <span class="smcap">Mud Baths</span> deserve the “passing tribute”
of a short notice. But alas! there is “nothing new under the sun”—or
under the earth. To the mud of the Nile and the Ganges, virtues almost
miraculous—even the creative power of life—have been attributed, time
immemorial. Who does not know that the life of <span class="smcap">Marius</span> was preserved
by a mud-bath in the Minturnian marshes?—The instincts of animals,
too, are not to be overlooked: We all know the extreme tenacity of life
possessed by eels—owing perhaps to their frequent use of mud-baths.
Swine are proverbially subject to cutaneous complaints, especially measles;
to prevent or cure which, Nature seems to prompt the daily employment
of mud-baths, in the Summer season. A remarkable instance of the force
of instinct is afforded by the Indian buffalo. That animal immerses himself
daily, during the hot season, in mud, up to the very nose; by which
means, we may conclude that he avoids the jungle fever, or cures himself
of liver-complaints. The alligator offers another example. When he has
swallowed a buffalo or a tiger, he buries himself up to the nose in mud, on
the oozy shores of the Ganges, no doubt for the promotion of digestion.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to multiply the virtues of mud-baths. Those who
desire ocular proofs must repair to Franzensbad in Bohemia, where they
will see—not mud but bog-baths in perfection; though they are now also
got up very well in Marienbad, Carlsbad, Teplitz, and other fashionable
spas.</p>

<p>I have alluded to the plentiful supply of bog which the immediate
vicinity of Franzensbad offers to the mud-bathers. This earth contains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the following materials:—viz: The fibres of plants not decomposed, and
whose organization is recognizable—matters soluble in water, such as
vegetable substances rich in carbon, and of a yellow colour;—sulphate of
lime—sulphate of magnesia—sulphate of iron—alum—bituminous extractive
matter—oxide of iron—fine sand.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the mere boggy material of the mud-bath contains
many substances that may and do exercise a considerable physiological
action on the body; and medicinal agency on the constitution.</p>

<p>The peat bog is carried to the neighbourhood of the baths, and there
allowed to dry to some extent. It is then sifted and separated from the
woody fibres and coarser materials, when it is mixed with the mineral water
of the Louisenquelle into the consistence of a very soft poultice. In this
state it is heated by steam to a temperature varying from 80° to 100° of
Fahrenheit, when it is ready for the bather, being worked up by means of
wooden instruments and the hands into a complete black amalgam. I took
the mud-bath here, at Marienbad, and Carlsbad, and do not regret the
experiments. I confess that, at first, I felt some repugnance, not fear, in
plunging into the black peat poultice; but when up to the chin (temperature
97°) I felt more comfortable than I had ever done, even in the
baths of Schlangenbad, Wildbad, or Pfeffers. The material is so dense,
that you are some time in sinking to the bottom of the bath—and I could
not help fancying myself in Mahomet’s tomb, suspended between Heaven
and Earth, but possessing consciousness, which I fear the prophet did not
enjoy. There was one drawback on the mud-bath, or peat-poultice. We
cannot roll about, like a porpoise or whale, as in the water-bath, without
considerable effort, so dense is the medium in which we lie; but I found
that I could use friction to all parts of the body, with great ease, in consequence
of the unctuous and lubricating quality of the bath. After
twenty minutes’ immersion, I felt an excitement of the surface, quite different
from that of the common mineral warm baths—even of those of
Wisbaden, Kissengen, or Schwalbach—attended, as I fancied, by elevation
of spirits.</p>

<p>Whilst I was thus philosophizing, like Diogenes in my tub, the thought
came across my mind that I would have a dive in the sable mixture. I
knew that the sun and winds had so tanned my complexion, that <span class="smcap">it</span> would
not suffer by immersion; and if my hair should get dyed black, the change
would certainly be for the better. I therefore disappeared like an eel in
the mud; but, on emerging from the bog, I thought I should have been
suffocated before I cleared my face from the tenacious cataplasm. I had
now been nearly half an hour in the Schlammbad, and prepared to quit,
as the mixture was fast cooling down, and the heat could not be kept up,
as in the water-bath. On raising myself slowly and perpendicularly, with
at least twenty pounds of mud on my surface, I caught a full length portrait
of myself in the glass, and I think the view would have sickened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Narcissus of self-contemplation for ever!! I was really shocked at my
sudden metamorphosis into the Œthiopian, and began to doubt whether
I should ever “change my hue” again. The warm water-bath was close
at hand, but I had the presence of mind not to jump into it at once, as
I should, in that case, render it a black wash-tub; but by clearing away
with both hands, some sixteen or eighteen pounds of peat varnish from
my body, I rolled into the clear fluid, where it required half an hour’s rubbing
and scrubbing to purify myself from the “Bain de Boue.” Both on
this, and on subsequent occasions, at Marienbad, Carlsbad, and Teplitz,
I experienced a degree of exhilaration, strength, and elasticity from the
mud-bath, which I had never done from any other. The iron in these
baths, instead of corrugating the skin, as I expected, imparts to it a glossy
or sattiny feel and softness quite peculiar—and much more in degree than
the waters of Schlangenbad.</p>

<p>The bog-earth is well picked, and in some places sifted, so as to remove
all the fibrous and woody parts, leaving the fat unctuous substance to be
mixed with the mineral water of the place. In general these baths produce
a pricking sensation, and sometimes an eruption on the skin, an effect
which I did not experience.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> They are therefore much used in old and
obstinate cutaneous complaints, as well as in glandular swellings, sequences
of gout, rheumatism, &amp;c. They are very exciting to the nervous system,
and should not be used where there are any local inflammations, or much
general excitability of the constitution. They do not lose their heat so
rapidly as the water-baths, and consequently they maintain the volatile
and penetrating principles longer than the latter. They are much employed
in paralysis, chronic ulcers, and cutaneous affections.</p>

<p>Here and at other spas where mud-baths are employed, I met with several
veteran warriors, whose aching wounds reminded them too often of battlefields
and bloody campaigns. They almost all agreed in attributing more
efficacy to these than to the common baths—and I think, from what I have
seen, heard, and felt, that there is much truth in these statements. The
Schlammbads have one advantage over the others, which is more prized on
the Continent than in England—the facilities which they afford the bathers,
both male and female, of receiving morning visits from their friends while
in the mud, and that without any violation of delicacy, propriety, or decorum;
for there, persons are more completely veiled than in any dress, even
of the most dense and sable furs of Russia. An English lady of rank, at
Teplitz, was visited by her physician and friends while immersed to the
chin in peat-bog. They read to her, and conversed with her till the signal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
was given for exchanging the black varnish for the limpid and purifying
wave, when they retired.</p>

<p>The rules for taking the Franzensbad waters and baths do not vary
materially from those of other spas. The following concise direction is
from the pen of Dr. Clarus.</p>

<p>“A complete course of these waters requires at least four weeks. When
it is thought desirable to take of more than one source, the change from
one well to another should not be abrupt, but gradual. We may commence
with one glass of the Salzquelle, and each day increase by the glass,
till, in a week, we come to six or seven glasses, taken at intervals of a
quarter of an hour. After this period, the Salzquelle is to be decreased,
glass by glass, and replaced by the Cold Sprudel. This change is to go on
during the second week. At the end of a fortnight, the Cold Sprudel is to
be changed, in the same gradual manner, for the Franzensquelle, which is
to be continued till the end of the course, unless some circumstances arise
to alter the arrangement. Those who are of very weakly constitutions,
and especially if they labour under any pulmonary complaint, will do well
to add some warm milk or whey to the mineral water.”</p>

<p>The baths are generally taken about two hours after breakfast. They
ought not to be taken unless the bowels are daily opened, either by the
waters or by aperient medicine. The temperature of the baths should be
about 98° of Fahrenheit, or that of the blood.</p>

<p>Baron Aimé has collected from various sources a host of cases, of all
kinds of maladies, cured or relieved by the waters of Franzensbad; but
into these it is unnecessary to go. Here the tyrant fashion has caused a
comparative desertion for the more attractive localities, if not more sanative
springs, of Marienbad, Carlsbad, and Teplitz. The qualities of the mud,
and the profusion of the gas, at Franzensbad, however, may probably turn
the current by and bye in its favour.</p>

<h4><i>Extract of a Letter from Mr. Spitta to Dr. Johnson.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,—I cannot quit the subject of Franzensbad without
entering into some detail on the celebrated Mud-baths. One hears much
of mud-baths at different spas of Germany: but a <i>genuine</i> Schlammbad is
<i>seen</i> only in Bohemia, and especially at Franzensbad.</p>

<p>The mud is obtained, as you are undoubtedly aware, from a large bog
or moor, situated at the back of the Louisen and Caltsprudel wells, which,
according to Dr. Kœstler, who accompanied me to examine it, is nine miles
by three in extent; and he tells me also that the same schlamm extends
to a <i>depth</i> of 20 feet. Indeed the whole village may be said to be resting
on this peat-earth; for you cannot dig up the soil to any depth without
discovering it. The surface of the moor looked singularly black and
barren; here and there, however, I discerned some yellow and white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
efflorescences. The yellow was by far the most abundant; and, wishing
to know its composition, I collected a considerable quantity and brought
it to England. It is a highly acid salt, permanently reddening litmus
paper, and extremely styptic and acid to the taste. I dried some carefully;
and found that 100 grains which had been completely desiccated, yielded
97.6 grains soluble in distilled water. The solution was dark brown, of
the colour of beer, and contained an acid per-sulphate of iron. The remaining
2.4 grains consisted principally of iron in combination with some
vegetable acid, or extractive matter.</p>

<p>I was sorry I could not collect sufficient quantity of the white efflorescence
for examination. I merely remember its <i>taste</i> to have been equally
styptic and disagreeable as the yellow.</p>

<p>There are several minerals found in this moor. I am indebted to Dr.
Palliardi (one of the resident medical men) for a good specimen of blue
phosphate of iron; of the hydrated red oxyd of iron; and for one of great
interest discovered <i>there</i> by himself, termed <i>Kieselguhr</i>. This substance
was first described by Professor Ehrenberg, of Berlin, to be an aggregation,
or to speak more accurately, the shells of a collection of different
species of infusoriæ. It is said to be pure silica—it is white; extremely
light and friable, and forms one of the most beautiful objects for the microscope
I have seen. I have a great quantity; and shall be happy to
furnish yourself, or any friend that may desire it, with a specimen.</p>

<p>I do not know whether you visited Dr. Palliardi’s study; it would have
been well worth the trouble. He is at once a mineralogist, a botanist, an
ornithologist, entymologist, chemist, and physician. I was pleased at
the simplicity with which they made a mud-bath—they merely picked and
sifted the mud (the sun having previously, to a certain extent, dried it)
and digested it in the water of the Louisenquelle warmed by steam. The
appearance of a bath when ready is anything but prepossessing; I must
confess, however, on making the trial, I was agreeably disappointed.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding my qualms, Dr. Kœstler insisted on my taking one, and
making myself acquainted with his darling Schlammbads from personal
experience; and I must say, when quietly seated in the mire, the sensations
were by no means disagreeable. In other hot mineral baths I almost
invariably experienced an oppression and anxiety at the chest; but here,
I know not why, the breathing was quite natural, and not at all hurried.
The black mess was extremely acid, violently and instantaneously reddening
litmus paper; and it exhaled a peculiar odour which I can compare to
nothing but to blacking. Its taste was styptic and saline—styptic evidently
from some salt of iron, and more saline than the water of any other mineral
bath. This is no more than would be expected when the quantity of
salt it contains is considered. I am informed by Dr. Kœstler that every
bath requires 250lbs. of schlamm, in which are contained 33lbs. of salts.
And this statement I should imagine to be tolerably correct, for I find that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
120 grs. of this mud yield 15.5 grains of matter soluble in water. The
solution is light brown, very acid, and contains the following substances:
1. A volatile acid, which was separated by distillation at temp. 230 circ.
and which had many of the leading characters of acetic acid, and on which
the peculiar odour of the bath depends.—2. Some fixed extractive matter
in combination with iron.—3. A large quantity of the persulphate of iron;
and 4. some sulphate of soda.</p>

<p>In examining this specimen, I was mostly struck with the very large
quantity of iron, and the comparative small quantity of other saline matter.
For a wonder it contained no <i>chloride</i>. There is a salt kept by the chemists
at Franzensbad, purporting to be the salt contained in the mud.
Had they said—made from the mud, they would have been correct. It is
perfectly neutral and efflorescent, and is nothing else but sulphate of soda,
with just sufficient persulphate of iron left unremoved, to tinge its solution.
The fact is—it is prepared by neutralising the acid solution of the mud by
<i>carb. soda</i>, and thus precipitating the iron, and retaining the salt of Glauber
in solution—one or two crystallisations furnish it tolerably pure. The
opinion that it contained the phosphate of soda and phosphate of iron, is
unfounded.</p>

<p>In many respects, the mud-bath is unique in its action on the human
body. From the quantity of saline matter it holds in solution, it acts as
a powerful stimulus to the skin, exciting the capillaries to renewed exertions;
hence its great use in gouty and rheumatic paralysis. The chalky
and fibrinous depositions which form this disease are absorbed under its
influence; and so effectual is it, that Dr. Kœstler, the oracle of Franzensbad,
will prophecy the recovery of a patient from this disheartening complaint,
after the far-famed hot springs of Teplitz have been tried in vain.</p>

<p>It is to this same property perhaps that its influence in chronic painful
affections of single nerves is to be attributed. The point whether salt is
actually absorbed from a bath is not, I believe, absolutely decided; but
certainly, if the fact be true, as is my firm belief, it is worthy of remark
to those patients who look for the tonic effect of the absorption of iron
into the blood, that it is in the mud-baths only that this metal is contained
in a soluble state. In the baths of <i>Schwalbach</i>, so famous for chlorosis,
there is plenty of iron; but it is in the form of an insoluble carbonate:
yet it is stated to be absorbed by the skin, and to produce its well-known
effect on the coloring matter of the blood; it has always appeared to me
that, provided chlorotic patients could bear the stimulation applied to the
surface, the mud-baths of Franzensbad would be pre-eminently serviceable.
This remark applies equally to some forms of hysteria; and to those irregular
muscular contractions of the limbs termed chorea. Indeed it is to
the absorption of this iron, I deem that the exhilarating effect universally
experienced after their use is to be attributed. Dr. Kœstler quoted to me
two cases of diabetes, in which these baths were extremely useful; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
could not however say were actually effectual. In conclusion, cutaneous
affections of a chronic character, unattended by fever, will be most effectually
benefitted; and I believe that these very obstinate complaints, which
baffle in so determined a manner the skill of the medical man, will derive
more benefit from the mud-baths of Franzensbad than from any other
mineral baths, with one exception—those of Kreuznach. I have entered
more fully than I had originally purposed into this subject; but I trust
that its very great interest, both in a scientific and medical point of
view, will be deemed a sufficient apology for trespassing so long on your
patience.</p>

<h3 id="MARIENBAD">MARIENBAD.</h3>

<p>At the distance of sixteen or eighteen English miles from Eger, lies the
now celebrated spa of Marienbad, though a place of yesterday, comparatively
speaking. It is situated in a gorge or small valley between cheerful
and pine-clad hills; and the houses being all modern, look extremely
well. Numerous shady walks are constructed in every direction; and two
murmuring and crystal streams run rapidly down the valley. Three of
the springs are within a few hundred yards of each other—viz. The
Kreuzbrunn, the Carolinenbrunn, and the Ambrosiusbrunn. The Ferdinandsbrunn,
lies about a mile out of the village. There is another spring
still farther in the woods, which contains only 7/10ths of a grain of solid
matter in the pint of water. It is called the Marienbrunnen.</p>

<h4>I. THE KREUZBRUNN.</h4>

<p>This is the lion of the place. It is the strongest of them all—its predominant
qualities being <i>solvent</i>, with an ulterior stimulant and tonic
property. It boils up under a beautiful building resembling a small Grecian
temple, from the entrance of which a fine shaded promenade, with a bazaar
on one side, and a dell on the other, extends to the Carolinenbrunnen. In
a pint of this spa there are 28½ grains of sulphate of soda—10 grains of
muriate of soda—7½ ditto of carbonate of soda—3 grains of carbonate of
lime—2 of carbonate of magnesia—⅒th of a grain of iron—some vegetable
extract, &amp;c. making 52 grains in the whole. The cubic inch of water
contains about a cubic inch of carb. acid gas.</p>

<p><i>Physiological Effects.</i>—This water sits easy on the stomach. Five or
six glasses are generally taken in the morning, without inconvenience, and
even with pleasure. When impurities, however, exist in the stomach or
bowels, the Kreuzbrunnen often causes sickness or disagreeable eructations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and then some opening medicine should be taken. If this water causes a
sense of distention, weight, or oppression at the stomach—or diarrhœa, or
loss of appetite, it is a sign that the water is taken in too large quantity—or
taken too fast—or taken too long—or, in fine, that it is not agreeing
with the individual. Very often, however, it is more owing to errors of
diet than to the nature of the waters that these phenomena occur.</p>

<p>In general the appetite is increased by the Kreuzbrunn, after the third
or fourth day. It augments considerably the action of the kidneys, the
water becoming more pale and copious—and this effect generally continues
during the period of the cure. It acts on the bowels also—five or six
glasses usually operating two or three times. The exported water is more
aperient than that taken at the source. The evacuations are often of a
green, black, or brown colour—or glairy, and gelatinous. Sometimes dark
coagulated blood is passed. When the motions become watery, the
Kreuzbrunn is not answering the purpose. The discharges above-mentioned
afford indescribable relief to the sufferer.</p>

<p>Things do not always, however, proceed so quietly. Occasionally the
abdomen becomes distended—the pulse accelerated—the bowels get confined—and
the fears of the hypochondriac are then greatly augmented.
According to Dr. Heidler, Dr. Herzig, and others, these symptoms are
<i>critical</i>, and soon disappear, when Nature has accomplished her object by
a discharge of vitiated excretions. It is quite a mistaken notion that the
dark or green colour of the motions is owing to the minute proportion of
steel contained in the water.</p>

<p>The <i>circulation</i> is sometimes disturbed. The head becomes giddy, the
chest oppressed, the pulse hard and frequent—with a sense of prostration,
or, on the contrary, of excitement. These are considered by the authorities
above-mentioned, as precursors of the critical discharges, and return of
health. In many cases such stormy crises do not take place, and the
cure is effected gradually and imperceptibly. In people of plethoric
habits and irritable temperaments, when any of the foregoing symptoms
occur, it is safest to mix the water with some warm milk, or allow the carbonic
acid gas to escape before it is taken. The Kreuzbrunnen, however,
is one of those solvent, and, at the same time, tonic waters (according to
Dr. Heidler) that may be taken by almost every one, whatever the age,
sex, or constitution, with little or no danger, even where there are complications
of organic diseases of the heart, lungs, or great vessels. In
such cases, the dilution with warm milk and the extrication of the gas, will
be proper. Dr. Heidler cites the case of a young lady who came to
Marienbad labouring under sympathetic hectic fever, and who had had
hæmoptysis. The stomach would retain no food—especially the dinner.
Constipation was obstinate, and nocturnal perspirations were profuse. The
Kreuzbrunn waters were taken, and, after eight days, the fever ceased.
In four weeks more the stomach became retentive. Next Summer, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
she returned to Marienbad, with the evening vomitings as before.
Eight days’ course of the waters dispelled the sickness, and she recovered
her health. The physicians of Marienbad exhibit the Kreuzbrunn to
people who have had apoplectic attacks, provided all symptoms of congestion
be removed before the waters are begun. In hæmorrhoidal and
other sanguineous fluxes, the same source may be used; but in moderate
quantities.</p>

<p>The effects of the Kreuzbrunn on the nervous system are much dwelt
on by Dr. Heidler and the other practitioners. They are considered to be
antispasmodic, and are highly praised in the numerous and Proteian forms
of hysteria, hypochondriasis, weakness of stomach, &amp;c. Many patients
of this kind recover at the Kreuzbrunn, after vainly trying more tonic
and chalybeate springs elsewhere.</p>

<p>In cases of pure debility, both of body and mind, the more tonic waters
of the Carolinenbrunn (to be presently noticed) are prescribed, together
with baths of the same. This water is much used in tremors of the limbs,
paralysis from mere weakness, or from losses of blood, excesses, severe
illnesses, distresses of mind, &amp;c. It is to be remembered, however, that
mere debility is but seldom the cause of these nervous sufferings; and that
the feelings of lassitude and exhaustion, the small pulse, cold extremities,
cramps and spasms, so frequent among hypochondriacs, are generally
symptoms or effects of congestion in the vessels of the liver and abdominal
organs, giving rise to irritation in the nervous system, constipation, and
morbid secretions. The classes of people who become hypochondriacal
are those who have lived well, both in food and drink, and who have led an
idle life, mental and bodily. In such, the pathological condition above-mentioned
is likely to occur. The action of the Kreuzbrunn is eminently
calculated to clear away viscid and unhealthy secretions, and rouse the
circulation of the liver and glandular organs of the abdomen. The
Marienbad physicians employ the Kreuzbrunn in gravelly complaints, but
in small quantities, and with good effects apparently.</p>

<p>The physiological action of this water on the lymphatic or absorbent
system, is very striking, as might be expected. Tumours of the glands,
especially if not of long-standing, disappear or greatly diminish during a
course of the Kreuzbrunn. Cutaneous complaints are generally cured
or ameliorated by the same waters assisted by baths.</p>

<p>But it is chiefly in chronic complaints of the abdominal, and
especially of the digestive organs, that the Kreuzbrunn is famous. The
symptoms which indicate the use of these waters, according to Dr. Heidler
and the other physicians of Marienbad, are the following:—yellow, pale,
or cachectic complexion—loss of appetite—distaste of food—sickness—furred
tongue with bitter taste in the morning—acid or rancid eructations—oppression
or cramps about the stomach—distention and tenderness of
the abdomen, local or general—colics—kidney-affections—constipation—diarrhœa—dysury—deposits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
in the water—irregularities of females—sterility—leucorrhœa—hypochondriasis—hysteria—epilepsy—various
and anomalous nervous affections—headaches of all kinds—giddinesses and
vertigo—noise in the ears—sleeplessness—asthma—anxiety about the
chest—palpitation of the heart—languor of the muscles—cold extremities—feeble
circulation—atrophy, &amp;c.</p>

<h4>II. FERDINANDSBRUNN.</h4>

<p>This spring lies about a mile out of the town, and has a greater affinity
to the Kreuzbrunn than any of the other wells of Marienbad. Its constituents
are as follow:—In the pint there are 17 grains of sulphate of
soda—7 grains of muriate of soda—6½ carbonate of soda—3 of carbonate
of lime—2 of carb. magnesia—⅓rd of a grain of carbonate of iron—traces
of carbonates of strontia, manganese, and lithian—in all 36½
grains—with 146 inches of carbonic acid gas to 100 cubic inches of the
water.</p>

<p>From the above analysis it will be seen that the Ferdinandsbrunn contains
nearly three times as much steel as the Kreuzbrunn, with considerably
more of carbonic acid gas; but it contains much less of the
sulphates and muriates of soda. Hence it is more tonic, and less aperient
than the master-spring, the <span class="smcap">Kreuzbrunn</span>. The water is clear and transparent
in the glass—sparkles like champagne—and has a most agreeable
refreshing taste. It leaves a slight smack of ink on the palate. It may
be administered in the same class of maladies as the Kreuzbrunn is applied
to—and that either simultaneously, alternately, or successively. Thus,
where the solvent powers of the former spring are still wanted, but the
debility of the patient requiring a more tonic source, the Ferdinandsbrunn
may be advantageously conjoined with the Kreuzbrunn, or substituted for
it during a period. It may be as well to cite a case or two here from my
friend Dr. Heidler.</p>

<p>“A gentleman, 60 years of age, who had led a sedentary life, and experienced
much trouble of mind, became extremely hypochondriac. When
he arrived at Marienbad, his complexion was cachectic—eyes dull and sunk—tongue
furred—appetite gone—abdomen distended, but not tender—hæmorrhoids—bowels
inactive—discharge of bloody mucus occasionally
with the motions—some eruption on the skin—slight wandering gouty
pains—skin dry—pulse small and slow. The Kreuzbrunn was first tried,
but produced watery evacuations, and distention of the stomach. The
Ferdinandsbrunn was therefore substituted at the end of ten days. This
water, in conjunction with mud-baths, produced, in the course of five
weeks, the most salutary effects, clearing the patient of his hypochondriasis,
and nearly the whole of the other symptoms.”</p>

<p><i>Case the second.</i>—“A gentleman, 50 years of age, who had lived well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
became weak and cachectic after some considerable hæmorrhoidal discharges—one
of them amounting to several pints of blood in one day. He had
derived considerable advantage from the waters of Carlsbad the preceding
year, but it increased the intestinal hæmorrhage. On his arrival at Marienbad,
he presented the following symptoms:—complexion pale, and
inclining to a yellow tint—lips bloodless, as was the tongue, and even the
palate—swelling of the eye-lids—small appetite—sleeplessness—rose from
bed more fatigued than when he lay down—great difficulty of breathing,
but without any symptoms of water in the chest, on ascending stairs—abdomen
distended, but soft, and without tenderness—constipation and
diarrhœa alternately—the pulse feeble and 85 to 95—skin rough and dry.</p>

<p>“The Kreuzbrunn was tried, but caused oppression at the stomach—diminution
of appetite, and watery evacuations. The Ferdinandsbrunn was
then employed, and agreed better, and produced more consistent motions, but
very unhealthy—some blood was passed each time from the hæmorrhoidal
vessels. The appetite soon increased—the digestion improved—and sleep
became more refreshing. Towards the end of the course, which lasted
five weeks, he was able to go up stairs without difficulty. He returned
two years afterwards to Marienbad, with the same symptoms, and was
again relieved.”</p>

<p>The Kreuzbrunn is preferable to the Ferdinandsbrunn, where the invalid
is of sanguine temperament, robust, inclined to apoplexy, or hæmorrhages.
Also for females who are subject to miscarriages—and, in general, for all
those who shew a tendency to fulness or congestion in any of the vital organs—diseases
of the chest—derangements of the circulation—inflammatory
complaints—and diseases of children.</p>

<h4>III. CAROLINENBRUNN AND AMBROSIUSBRUNN.</h4>

<p>These two springs are near each other, and only a few hundred yards
distant from the Kreuzbrunn. They come under the head of “acidulous
chalybeates,” and only differ from each other in strength—the Carolinenbrunn
being rather more potent than the Ambrosiusbrunn, as the following
analysis will show. The <span class="smcap">Carolinenbrunn</span> contains in the pint of water,
2½ grains of sulphate of soda-½ grain muriate of soda—⅔rds of a grain
of carbonate of soda—nearly a grain of carbonate of lime—3 grains of
magnesia—⅓rd of a grain of carbonate of iron—in all amounting to about
9 grains—and 123 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas in 100 cubic inches
of the water.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Ambrosiusbrunn</span> contains only six grains of solid matters in the
pint—the iron being only ¼ of a grain. The other ingredients are the
same in kind as in the Carolinenbrunn, but one-third smaller in quantity.
The carbonic acid gas is also rather smaller in quantity.</p>

<p>Dr. Heidler considers the Ambrosiusbrunn as bearing considerable
analogy to Bruckenau, Bocklet, and the Stahlbrunn at Swalbach; but as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
far as the chemical composition is concerned, there is much difference, as
may be perceived by reference to those springs. Dr. H. prefers the Ambrosiusbrunn
for children, and also for adults of very weak and delicate
constitutions, as preparatory to the water of the Carolinenbrunn. It is
easy of digestion, and may be taken for a long time, without inconvenience.
It is very useful in gravelly complaints.</p>

<p>The Carolinenbrunn is of more extensive application than the Ambrosiusbrunn;
but much less so than the Kreuzbrunn, or even the Ferdinandsbrunn.
Experience has shewn that the “<i>acidulous chalybeates</i>,” whose
properties are exciting and tonic, are much less useful in chronic diseases
than those which are solvent, and which produce crises in the course of
their operation—especially through the medium of the bowels and the
kidneys.</p>

<p>The first impression of the Carolinenbrunn on the stomach is excitant
and refreshing, like all other acidulous springs. It has been generally used
by the inhabitants as common drink; and yet it does not digest so easy,
among the invalids, as the other springs of Marienbad—many of them
experiencing weight and oppression at the epigastrium, particularly if they
are weak and irritable constitutions, or labouring under any congestion or
engorgement of the abdominal organs. It is much less aperient than the
Kreuzbrunn and the Ferdinandsbrunn—indeed it often confines the
bowels, and then the patient must take some of the other waters with the
Carolinenbrunn or aperient medicine. This spring is the strongest in iron
of all the others. It bears the greatest affinity to Schwalbach and Spa;
but is a stronger chalybeate, and contains more carbonic acid gas than
they do. It leaves an <i>après-gout</i> of steel on the palate, as also of sulphur.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The Carolinenbrunn may be classed amongst the exciting and tonic
waters. It moderately excites the circulation and the nervous system, by
a transient stimulation, which does not leave a debility behind. Although
it is not aperient, it rarely produces astringent effects, like bark, steel and
other tonics. It augments the action of the kidneys—and may be said to
gently increase the activity of the whole organism, without checking any
of the secretions. It is therefore prescribed, with much advantage, in all
cases of pure debility, and unattended with any fever or local inflammation.
Care ought always to be taken that the bowels are cleared of all
impurities before this water is used, and that constipation is guarded
against during the course. It is used in baths. The rules for using the
waters are not materially different from those enforced at other spas. The
season lasts from the beginning of May till the end of September.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE BATHS.</h4>

<p>The baths of Marienbad are on a splendid scale—including the mineral
water—the gas—and the mud baths. The grand source of the waters for
bathing is the <span class="smcap">Marienbrunn</span>, which furnishes 5280 cubic feet of water in
24 hours. The basin is large and capacious—entirely covered over—and
the carbonic acid gas boils up in all directions, and in globes and globules
of all sizes, with astonishing vehemence and agitation. The disengagement
of gas here is, in my opinion, much more striking and wonderful
than at the Cold Sprudel and its neighbour at Franzensbad. There is
always a thick stratum of this deadly gas incumbent on the surface of the
water. There is an admixture of sulphuretted hydrogen gas with the
carbonic. All the experiments that are made on animals at the famous
Grotto del Cane, near Naples, may be repeated here with perfect success.
The Marienbrunn is more elevated than the bathing-establishments, so
that the water is conveyed fresh from the source, through pipes that prevent
all decomposition.</p>

<h4>PHYSICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF THE BATHS.</h4>

<p>1. Soon after entering the bath—say at blood heat—innumerable globules
of carbonic acid gas are seen on the surface of the body. 2. Many people
perceive a redness of the skin, soon after immersion, accompanied by a
sense of heat, even when the bath is not above 88° or 90° of Fahrenheit.
3. Some people of irritable and sensitive constitutions, on the contrary,
experience a slight shiver, even when the temperature of the water is above
that of the blood. This phenomenon is, however, rare. 4. The bath occasions
a prompt and copious secretion from the kidneys. 5. Many people
who have had old wounds, fractures, or ulcers, feel pains in the parts,
while immersed in the water. 6. The same may be said of gout and
rheumatism; and this renewal of pains is considered a favourable omen.
7. Old and ill-conditioned ulcers soon assume a more healthy appearance
under the use of the baths, and take on a more active, or even inflammatory
condition. Ulcers ought to be covered with oil-silk or other defence
while the patient is in the bath. 8. In the course of the bathing—generally
after ten or fourteen days, any eruptions that previously existed
become more developed—and very often new cutaneous eruptions come out.
These are considered to be more or less salutary.</p>

<p>The Marienbrunn water is much weaker than the Kreuzbrunn and other
drinking springs, and is soon decomposed by exposure to the atmosphere.
These baths are contra-indicated, or even prejudicial in cases of dropsy,
phthisis, aneurysms, irritations or inflammations of any important organ,
especially if accompanied by fever or suppuration—disposition to hæmorrhages,
or vomitings of blood—disposition to miscarriage—paralyses the
result of apoplexy. With these exceptions there are few chronic diseases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
which may not be benefitted by the Marienbad baths in conjunction with
the internal use of the waters.</p>

<p>It is chiefly, however, in gout, rheumatism, tic-douloureux, paralytic
debility without preceding apoplexy or affection of the head, scrofula, cutaneous
eruptions, stiffness and contractions of joints, and old sores, that
the baths of Marienbad are recommended as essential auxiliaries to the
waters internally. The baths are generally used at a temperature of 94°
to 98°, and at any time of the day except when digestion is going on after
dinner.</p>

<h4>MUD-BATHS.</h4>

<p>These are in great requisition at Marienbad. The peat bog is found
near the spa. It is of a very dark brown colour—friable when dried, and
unctuous to the feel when wetted. It is here, as elsewhere, the product of
vegetable matters decomposed by water, and highly impregnated with carbonic
acid gas and sulphuretted hydrogen, which gases are disengaged in
prodigious quantities. Much sulphur is found in this earth, together with
various mineral salts, as hydro-chlorate of soda, sulphate of soda—sulphates
of lime and magnesia—carbonate of iron—silex—alum—bitumen,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Besides the general effects of hot, warm, and tepid baths of mineral
water, the mud-baths exhibit effects peculiar to themselves. They may be
taken at a higher temperature than water-baths, without inconvenience.
They are never employed cold. They excite the skin much more than the
liquid baths,—cause a greater degree of redness—bring out more eruptions—and
stimulate the nerves of the surface, as well as the vessels. They
are employed by the Marienbad physicians in all those cases where the
mineral-water baths are used. They are preferred, however, to the latter,
in all those maladies where the natural and salutary crisis takes place
chiefly through the excretories of the surface, and by determination to the
joints, as in gout; and in those cases where the disease is attributed to
checked perspiration. The mud-baths are much employed by Dr. Heidler,
Dr. Herzig, and others, as local applications in various local maladies, as,
for example, in swellings and stiffness of the joints—old wounds—ulcers—neuralgic
affections, &amp;c.</p>

<p>As the stratum of mud in contact with the body soon loses some of its
caloric, it is proper and even necessary, to keep moving about in the bath,
and using friction with the hands as well as motion with the limbs. The
fluid bath, which is placed at the side of the mud-bath, loses temperature
also, while the bather is in the latter, and as it is often a moveable tub,
warm water cannot be always added to it—therefore it should be two or
three degrees higher than usual when operations are commencing. No
time should be spent in the washing-bath longer than is necessary for
cleaning the surface of the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Having used the mud-baths both at Franzensbad and Marienbad, and
accurately watched their effects on my own person, I can aver that I perceived
no difference, either in sensible properties or physiological results,
between the mud-baths of the two places. I always felt more exhilarated
through the day, when I used the mud, than when I took the common
mineral-water bath.</p>

<h4>GAS-BATHS.</h4>

<p>At Marienbad, as at Franzensbad, the carbonic acid gas rises from the
earth in such abundance, that it is only necessary to inclose a piece of
ground and form a reservoir, when the deadly mephitic gas collects in such
quantities as would destroy the whole population of those spas in a few
minutes! But as the most potent poisons have been converted into the
most efficient remedies, so has this deleterious emanation from the bowels
of the earth, been made an instrument for restoring various lost powers in
the human frame. The application of this gas is only of modern date.
The first notice I have seen is in the Dict. des Sciences Medicales, 1812.
Since then Dr. Heidler, Dr. De Carro, and others have published on this
subject. The gas-bath was first used at Marienbad about twenty years
ago, on the following occasion. Dr. Struve, of Dresden, had been using
the waters and baths of Marienbad for a painful affection of the left thigh
and leg, which prevented him from walking without crutches, and, on any
little exertion, caused the most excruciating pain. A number of lymphatic
glands were swelled in the course of the vessels of that limb, and the
vessels themselves were enlarged and inflamed, though the limb was emaciated.
He had a gorged liver and hæmorrhoids. He exposed the afflicted
member daily to the action of the carbonic acid gas, which always floats
on the surface of the Marienbrunn; and the following were his words:—“I
soon felt an agreeable warmth creep up the limb exposed to the gas,
which went on increasing, accompanied by a sense of formication (creeping
of ants) over the skin. After half an hour’s application, on the first trial,
I removed from the Marienbrunn, by the aid of my servant and crutches;
but my astonishment was great, when I found that I could put my foot to
the ground with increased power, and that the painful titillation soon subsided.
In the course of a few days the power of the limb was so far
augmented that I was able to walk without crutches or even a stick. I
continued, however, the Kreuzbrunn water internally—the mud-poultices
to the limb—and the gas-bath for three weeks, when the cure was complete
and permanent.”<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>This almost miraculous cure attracted Dr. Heidler’s attention to the
subject, and, from that period, he has made numerous experiments on other
patients, with this new remedy, as well as on himself personally, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
published the results in the year 1819, at Vienna. The succeeding year
six gas-bathing chambers were constructed, and now, (August 1840) this
gas-bathing establishment is on the completest scale of perfection. The
Count St. Leu, and Marshal Schwarzenberg, were among the first patients
who used the gas-baths after their establishment in 1819. The physicians
of Marienbad have, ever since the last-mentioned period, employed this
remedy in a great number of cases and diseases, and, they informed me,
with great advantage.</p>

<p>The sensible effects are chiefly as follows:</p>

<p>1. A sensation of heat (sometimes preceded by a slight coldness) very
soon is felt after entering the gas-bath, beginning at the feet and mounting
upwards over the whole body, in the majority of cases, but, in others, it
is most sensibly experienced in those parts of the body or limbs which are
or were the seats of diseases. In the abdomen, and especially in the lower
parts of the pelvis, this pleasant sensation of heat is more felt than in the
chest—a fact which led to the application of gas to certain complaints in
both sexes attended with torpor and debility of particular functions.</p>

<p>2. A sensation of twitching, formication, and even pain, is often the
result of the gas-bath, especially in parts which have formerly been the
seat of fractures, sprains, wounds, or severe gout or rheumatism. These
pains are so acute as sometimes to force the patient to quit the bath before
the usual time has expired. On the other hand, most excruciating pains
of rheumatism, tic, &amp;c. unaccompanied by inflammation, have been instantaneously
relieved by the application of the gas. 3. Perspiration is
generally produced or augmented by the bath, either at the time of immersion,
a few hours afterwards, or in the following night. 4. The gas-bath
sometimes brings on, at others regulates, periodical discharges,
hæmorrhoidal or otherwise. 5. The gas-bath is exciting or even irritating
to the organs of respiration, and should not be used where there is any
inflammatory action or congestion in the chest. 6. If a certain proportion
of the gas gets mixed with the common air, and is thus breathed, it produces
giddiness, vertigo, anguish at the pit of the stomach, and oppression
about the lungs. If the <i>pure gas</i> is breathed, instant death is the result.
A few years ago the life of a female peasant was lost by the stupidity of
her husband, who put the cover of the bath over her head, instead of being
round her throat. No one is now allowed to take a gas-bath without the
medical or some experienced attendant.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>The carbonic acid gas is generally employed here in commixture with a
small proportion of sulphuretted hydrogen gas.</p>

<p>The mode of action of the gas-bath being decidedly stimulant, it should
never be employed where stimulants are improper. The disorders in which
it is most employed by Dr. Heidler, Dr. Herzig, and other physicians at
Marienbad, are the following:—1. Suppressed or scanty menstruation—especially
after the waters and common baths have been used without
effect. 2. Suppressed hæmorrhoidal discharges, in which the mineral
waters may also be employed. 3. In scrofulous ulcers and swellings,
aided by the mud-baths and mineral water. 4. Various derangements of
digestion, where there is no plethora of any of the abdominal organs. 5.
In gouty affections of a painful kind, without actual inflammation, and
where the other baths and waters have proved ineffectual. In such cases,
the gas-baths often bring out an acid and fætid perspiration on the pained
part. 6. In some chronic affections of the sight, as amaurosis, not accompanied
by inflammatory symptoms, the local application of the gas
has been found useful: also in deafness dependent on torpor of the nerves
and membranes of the ear, or where the natural secretion is defective or
nul. Great caution, however, is necessary in the local application of
streams of this gas to the eyes or ears, where there is any tendency to
vertigo, or fulness about the head.</p>

<p>The gas-baths are taken locally or generally. In the general bath the
patient should be lightly cloathed, as the gas generally induces perspiration.
When it is used locally, by way of douche, it may often be applied
to the naked part, or with a gauze covering over the surface, especially if
to the eyes. Care should always be taken to prevent the introduction of
gas into the lungs—or even into the mouth or nose, lest disagreeable consequences
should ensue.</p>

<p>This new remedy has attracted individuals of both sexes to Franzensbad
and Marienbad, from the wilds of Russia, and from various parts of
the South and centre of Europe. Those who come with the greatest
anxiety, and with the most ardent hopes, or at least expectations, to the
gas-baths, are such as have long sighed, but sighed in vain, to become—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The tenth transmitters of some foolish face,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">placing, apparently, more faith in the physical operation of the waters,
baths, and gases of the spas, than in the intercession of saints or even the
prayers which they had offered up at the shrine of the Madonna herself!
How far and how often the gas-baths have wrought the happy revolution,
I cannot say. The doctors have firmly asserted, and the patients have
willingly believed the “flattering tale.” As the gas-baths are seldom
trusted to alone, it is impossible to say with accuracy, what share they
have in the general restoration of health, and the consequent invigoration
of the constitution. Upon the whole, I left Marienbad with the strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
conviction on my mind, that its waters and baths were among the most
efficient in the list of the German spas.</p>

<p>The valley of Marienbad is well sheltered, and surrounded by pines in
the immediate neighbourhood of the spa; but we have only to mount a
couple of miles on the Carlsbad road, when we get into a high open country,
with a bracing air and a boundless prospect. Some parts of this route
are extremely picturesque—I would almost say romantic, especially a few
miles from Marienbad, where the road winds down a precipice in numerous
tourniquets, into a valley surrounded on all sides by steep acclivities, some
bare and rugged, others crowned with woods. A rivulet roars through the
valley, and a village, a convent, and some factories, give cheerfulness and
animation to the scene.</p>

<p>P.S.—Before quitting the subject of the Marienbad waters, I must
dedicate a few lines to a small brochure on these waters, published by my
friend Dr. Herzig, in the Summer of 1840.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">Die Heilung der Krankheiten, mit hulfe des Kreuzbrunnen zu
Marienbad. Von Dr. L. Herzig.—The Cure of Diseases by the
help of the Marienbad Waters.</p>

</div>

<p>The water of the Marienbad springs has a soothing effect on the nervous
system, and checks vomiting and pain in the stomach and bowels, in consequence
partly of the carbonic acid contained in the water, and partly of
its property of increasing all the secretions.</p>

<p>In plethoric persons it often proves stimulating, and causes headache,
redness of face, and feelings of cerebral congestion—owing probably to the
carbonic acid and the iron contained in it.</p>

<p>Its most marked effect is to increase all the secretions, especially those
of the bowels, liver, kidneys and skin—large quantities of mucus are discharged
with the stools. The mucous secretions of the bladder, and also
of the vagina, are usually much increased at first, but subsequently greatly
diminished, when these organs are in a state of weakness. Various forms
of cutaneous eruption often make their appearance, and rheumatic and
gouty pains are usually increased at first, but subsequently disappear
during the use of the waters.</p>

<p>The digestive and nutritive functions are quickened and invigorated, and
the patients acquire strength and liveliness, in consequence of the improved
state of the intestinal secretions. The Kreuzbrunn waters at Marienbad
produce similar effects to those of the Carlsbad and the Kissengen
waters; but the former are more purging and evacuant, and act less upon
the vascular system, and more upon the digestive functions than they do.</p>

<p>The diseases in which the Marienbad waters are most useful, are—</p>

<p>1. All congested states of the <i>portal</i> system of veins, indicated by torpid
bowels, loss of appetite, hæmorrhoids, and gouty complaints; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
various diseases connected with inactivity of the abdominal circulation,
such as hypochondriasis, dyspepsia, morbid sensibility, headaches, &amp;c.
Numerous cases of chronic rheumatism and gout, which are so frequently
associated with congestion of the vena portæ, are relieved by the use of
the Marienbad waters.</p>

<p>2. Diseased state of the mucous membranes, such as some obstinate
catarrhs, affections of the mucous coat of the bladder, uterus, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. Plethora, sanguineous congestions, crampy pains of the limbs, absent
or difficult menstruation, and the numerous morbid symptoms dependent
upon this state.</p>

<p>4. Torpor of the bowels, and its host of attendant evils.</p>

<p>“By means of its property of increasing all the secretions and excretions
of the body, and of bringing out cutaneous eruptions and gouty affections
to the limbs, the Kreuzbrunn waters at Marienbad are an excellent
remedy in numerous diseases which depend either upon a plethoric state of
the abdominal circulation, or upon the accumulation of impurities in the
bowels, or upon an unhealthy condition of the mucous membranes. At
the same time, they subdue the morbid irritability of the whole system, or
of individual parts; they remove congestions, plethora, and various evils
dependent upon these. They are especially useful in all cases where
Nature herself seems to be striving to induce either an increase of the secretions,
or a flow of blood from certain parts, as the nose, anus, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>When the Marienbad waters do not prove sufficiently aperient, a small
portion of Glauber or Epsom salts may be added to it. In some cases,
the waters will agree better, if previously heated; and in others, they
are usefully combined with a little warm milk, or with a small portion of
wine.</p>

<p>Dr. Herzig is an attentive physician, who speaks English, and may be
usefully consulted by my countrymen. I have also to express my grateful
thanks to Dr. Heidler, the spa physician of Marienbad, for his kindness and
attention.</p>

<p>This is denominated the <span class="smcap">King</span> of the Spas, whilst Baden-Baden is the
<span class="smcap">Queen</span>. I wish his majesty of the “<span class="smcap">Warm Wassers</span>” had condescended
to hold his noisy court a little nearer to that of his royal consort. Two
hundred and thirty miles from Frankfort, through a country that is not
always very smooth, or very interesting—with dust in some places half a
foot deep on the roads—the thermometer at 80°—and the rate of progression
five miles an hour, is a tolerable sacrifice to the hygeian goddess of
the Sprudel! It is not improbable that many of those who travel to Bohemia,
in search of health, might find it in various other directions, and
much nearer their own doors. The journey itself requires some good
stamina, as well as resolution, and, if borne well, gives promise of success
at the Sprudel.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>I suppose Carlsbad claims the prerogative of curing by the “<i>Royal
touch</i>,” all those maladies that resist the powers of his subject spas—and
even of the Queen’s own at Baden.</p>

<p>I think I have discovered one cause of the great efficacy of the Carlsbad
waters, which has escaped the notice of the spa doctors, including my
friend Dr. Granville. In travelling to Bohemia, the invalid must, on a
moderate calculation, swallow full a pound of sand and dust on the road.
This being mixed with an indefinite quantity of grease, oil, and vinegar,
at the hotels, forms a kind of amalgam, resembling “<i>fuller’s earth</i>,” the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
clearing away of which, by the hot and alkaline waters of Carlsbad, must
leave the stomach, liver, kidneys, and other internal organs, as bright and
shining as a newly-scoured copper kettle.</p>

<p>It is ascertained that Carlsbad is built on a thin crust of limestone,
forming a dome over several immense cauldrons of boiling mineral water.
At present the chief crater of this aqueous volcano offers a safety-valve for
all the superfluous soda-water unconsumed by the subterranean spa-goers;
but it has often been feared that the whole dome may one day fall in, when
the bibbers and bathers, the ramblers and gamblers, the sick and the sound,
will all have a dip in the Sprudel at its natural temperature, and without
the expense of 48 kreutzers for the bath!</p>

<p>On some occasions the usual vent of the Sprudel has become obstructed,
and then the ground in the neighbourhood has trembled and vibrated,
as if from an earthquake. At one time the pent up water burst out in
the bed of the river: and here they have formed a large shield of wood
and stones, clasped with iron, with a plug or safety-valve in the centre,
along the sides of which the steam and water now oozes out, and the
aperture can be enlarged at any moment by removing the plug, when
another Sprudel rises in the middle of the Teple.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, Carlsbad may now be considered as the grand
“<span class="smcap">Maison de Santé</span>” of Europe, where the patients support themselves,
on the principle of the Sanataria in general, and where Mr. Owen might
find his social system almost perfect. Thus we have at Carlsbad (and indeed
at most of the great German spas,) our food in common—our physic
in common—and even our physician in common. The air we breathe, the
water we drink, and gardens and walks where we exercise, are all in common.
The socialists might even find little reason to complain of that
“accursed thing,” <span class="smcap">matrimony</span>, for although <i>matches</i> are occasionally
projected at Carlsbad, I believe that <i>marriage</i> is seldom perpetrated there.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>This great valetudinarium then presents four or five wards or hygeian
fountains, of which the <span class="smcap">Sprudel</span> stands most conspicuous. I was completely
disappointed at the first sight of this lion of the Spas. The descriptions
and drawings of the spring are most outrageously exaggerated. One
would expect to see a fountain of boiling fluid rising to a height of six or
eight feet, and falling down in fervid and foaming showers. No such thing.
During half the time, it does not rise above the level of the kettle in which
it boils; and is often below that mark. Then it mounts a foot or so,
and every now and then spirts a small irregular and ragged pillar or
column of foaming water to a height of two, three, or perhaps four feet
above the reservoir. More frequently, however, it squirts a jet of water
to one or the other side of the kettle, which splashes into the conduits that
carry it off. The whole of the kettle, reservoir, and exits are coated with
calcareous deposits, and, in many parts covered with green matter, the
bodies or receptacles of animalculæ. Still the Sprudel is a stupendous
ebullition of hot medicinal water from some infernal laboratory, amply
sufficient for the expurgation of a whole nation! The temperature of the
water is 168° of Fahrenheit, each pint containing about 44 grains of solid
matters, of which the sulphates, carbonates, and muriates of soda form 37
grains. A trace, and merely a trace, of iron is found in the water. Some
very recent analyses have also detected traces of iodine, and of an animal
substance, together with some sulphuretted hydrogen gas. Its taste is
certainly not very agreeable and rather mawkish—and though clear at the
fountain, it is turbid when cold. It very much resembles the Cockbrunnen
in savour.</p>

<p>The second spring is the <span class="smcap">Muhlbrunn</span>, whose temperature is nearly 30°
below that of the <span class="smcap">Sprudel</span>; but whose constituent salts are the same.
Nevertheless this difference of temperature is supposed to produce a difference
in the taste of the water, and renders it more acceptable to the
stomachs, or at least to the palates, of many of the drinkers at Carlsbad.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Neubrunn</span> is separated from the former source only by a covered
walk, and marks 144° of heat. It did not appear to me to be so much in
vogue at this fashionable watering-place, as the Muhlbrunnen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Behind the Neubrunn there is a hill, cut into terraces and gravelled
walks, where rises the <span class="smcap">Theresienbrunn</span>—a spring much frequented by
the ladies, and indeed by both sexes. The temperature is only 134° of
Fahrenheit, and the water is almost tasteless. These three (with the Hygienequelle,
close to the Sprudel) are the chief springs, which are much
frequented by the great mass of bibbers at Carlsbad.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>The waters of all the springs deposit abundance of calcareous matters,
which crystallize in stalactites of all shapes and hues, called <i>Sprudelstein</i>,
and give employment to numerous hands in the formation of snuff-boxes
and various kinds of bijoux.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> As incrustations form on the surfaces of
any woody, mineral, or vegetable substance immersed in these waters, a
fear is sometimes engendered in timid minds that similar incrustations
might form in the stomach, bowels, or kidneys of those who drink them!
It has been proved by Dr. De Carro and others, that the stalactitious deposits
will not take place on any <i>animal</i> substance, with the exception of
the teeth. Even here, the quantity of stony matter is so small in a dozen
beakers of the Sprudel, that nothing is to be apprehended to the teeth on
this score. It would, perhaps, be a happy circumstance for Germany, if
the Sprudel had the faculty of encrusting the teeth with a calcareous
enamel! If such were the case, the whole of the five springs at Carlsbad
would be insufficient to supply dentrifice varnish enough!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>A serio-comic anecdote is related of a hypochondriac, who had drunk
of these waters for some weeks before the <i>petrifying</i> thought flashed across
his mind, (in consequence of some uneasy sensations in his stomach) that
incrustations were forming in his interior. From that moment he became
firmly convinced that snuff-boxes, heads of canes, Madonnas, and even
crucifixes, were torturing his entrails! He drenched himself daily with
drastic purgatives—but, unfortunately, no stalactites came forth: on the
contrary, his inward pains and miseries were increased by the very means
that were employed to expel the enemy! Whether he ever recovered from
his imaginary sufferings is not known.</p>

<p>Another source of terror to the timid and nervous drinkers at Carlsbad
has lately arisen. A learned German philosopher has discovered living
fossil animalculæ in the waters of Carlsbad. Now if these little salamanders
can “live and move, and have their being,” in the Sprudel at a
temperature of 167°—or rather in the bowels of the earth, where the
water is at the boiling point, or even in the form of steam, it may well be
supposed that they would thrive luxuriously in the temperate climate of
the human stomach, where the heat does not exceed 98° of Fahrenheit.
However, the drinkers of the Thames water need have no fears respecting
the <span class="smcap">Infusoria</span> of Carlsbad, which would soon be devoured by the proteiform
monsters which are daily ingurgitated by the citizens of London.</p>

<p>I have already stated that some of the philosophic spa doctors have
broached the doctrine, that mineral waters are merely <i>secretions</i> from one
great watery being residing deep in the bowels of the earth! As the secretions
from the human body are very various, so the secretions from the
mother Spa are almost innumerable, and thus the infinite variety of mineral
waters is readily explained and accounted for. Q. E. D.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>The situation of Carlsbad is very picturesque—I might say romantic.
It might be pretty well characterised by a single line, descriptive of a very
different locality—the valley of the <span class="smcap">Upas tree</span>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Rocks rise on rocks and fountains gush between.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>The town is built partly in the valley, partly on the ledges of granite
rocks that rise abruptly behind it, to a height of 1500 feet, while the lazy
<span class="smcap">Teple</span>—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Slow as Lethe’s stream,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">creeps at a snail’s space through the vale, contrasting remarkably with the
boisterous, foaming, upheaving, and boiling <span class="smcap">Sprudel</span>, that gushes from
unknown and unfathomable depths in the bowels of the earth, carrying
health and life to its unnumbered votaries.</p>

<p>Carlsbad cures, as a matter of course, nine-tenths of human maladies;
but as King of the Spas, it has a royal prerogative of a curious and important
nature—namely, the power of curing those diseases which resist
the virtues of all other spas and all other remedies! In answer to a question,
“why Carlsbad sustained its reputation undiminished?” <span class="smcap">Hufeland</span>
replied—“C’est qu’il guérit des maux rebelles a tout autre moyen curatif.”
It is true that, if we take the testimonies of the other spas, none of which
admit their fallibility in any case, this prerogative of Carlsbad would be
little more than a sinecure; but the promises of spa doctors, like the
waters which they prescribe, must be taken <i>cum grano salis</i>; and we may
safely conclude that some maladies present themselves at the Sprudel which
have resisted the Cockbrunnen, as well as many other brunnens between
the Rhine and the Danube.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>The attestations to the power of the Carlsbad prerogative would fill a
volume. One just before me, as recorded by Dr. Granville, on the authority
of a British nobleman, well known in the world of wit, is worthy
of notice. Lord A——, it appears, through the efficacy of the Carlsbad
waters, “had lost a <i>pleuritic adhesion</i> under the sternum (or breast bone)
the consequence of neglected inflammation in the chest, which had annoyed
him for a long time, and resisted all curative means. The complaint made
him short-breathed in ascending hills, and gave him a dragging sensation
whenever he sneezed—all which symptoms have since disappeared.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether his lordship’s breathing, and consequently his years, have been
lengthened by the dissolution of substernal <i>adhesions</i>, or by certain <i>corporate
reforms</i> effected by the Sprudel, may admit of some doubt; but the
narrative shews on what sort of evidence the miracles of the spas sometimes
rest! Not that this evidence is worse than we have often at home—witness
the attestation on oath by a nobleman, that he saw St. John Long
extract quicksilver from the brain of a man who had taken mercury—and
the solemn assertions of grave and learned doctors, that an Irish girl could
see through her navel, and hear with the points of her fingers!!</p>

<p>If we estimate the number of cures by the number of candidates, this spa
must be “a sovereign remedy” for many of our ills. But this criterion is
not always correct. It is not always the physician who sees most patients
that cures most diseases. But Carlsbad, like other bads, has a very convenient
postern to retreat through, when hard pressed for testimonials.
Thus, if the first season fails, the most confident hopes are held out that
the second will succeed. If the second turn out a miscarriage, then the
third will prove infallible! It requires no ghost to prophesy that, if the
pilgrim of the spas goes two successive years to Bohemia, without relief,
the third pilgrimage will, in all human probability, be to that “undiscovered
country,” whence no invalids return to tell their tale of disappointment!
If a patient die at home, it is because he did not visit Carlsbad—if at
Carlsbad, because he came too late.</p>

<p>The waters of Carlsbad were formerly used almost entirely as baths—but
now it is just the reverse—they are chiefly taken internally. In former
times the bathers passed eight or ten hours in the baths, as they now do
at Leuk, Baden, and Pfeffers. My friend De Carro thinks that, formerly,
cutaneous complaints were more rife—and now, that liver and stomach affections
are the prevailing maladies—hence the change from bathing to drinking
at this celebrated spa. There may be some truth in this. The taste of these
waters very much resembles that of weak chicken-broth, with a flat and
alkaline savour. It has been seen that <span class="smcap">soda</span>, combined with sulphuric,
muriatic, and carbonic acids, is the chief agent in the Carlsbad waters.
Soda uncombined with acids, either out of or in the body, has rather a
deleterious effect on the organs of circulation and digestion. “But the
Carlsbad water (says Chev. De Carro) though used for a long time, reanimates,
vivifies, excites the appetite, and promotes digestion—thus with
proper regimen, restoring the patient to health.” Doubtless the efficacy of
the waters is augmented by the admixture, however small in quantity, of
other elements, as the oxide of iron, the carbonic acid, the iodine, and
materials yet unknown, diffused in extreme solution, through a fluid of a
very high temperature, which enables the component parts of the spring
to permeate the minutest vessels of the body. The Carlsbad salts are
found in the renal secretion, as well as in the cutaneous transpiration, after
being taken internally. These waters act by exciting the stomach, bowels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
kidneys, liver, and abdominal organs generally, augmenting the secretions
and excretions—especially those of the intestines, sometimes it is said even
to purgation, when they are taken in considerable quantity. This effect,
however, must be rather unfrequent, for I found no one, including myself,
who experienced it. “They excite the circulation, so as frequently to produce
palpitation of the heart, and determination of blood to the head. This
water augments the activity of the absorbents; but it is not till after its
other operations, that it acts as a direct <span class="smcap">tonic</span>.” Purgation is not considered
by the Carlsbad doctors as essential to its beneficial agency, which is
often produced without any action on the bowels, but only on the various
secretions already mentioned. In all cases, however, it is necessary to
guard against constipation, by adding some Carlsbad salts to the water, or
exhibiting some other aperient. Although these waters contain no sulphuretted
hydrogen gas, or extremely little, they produce fætid eructations
from the stomach when drunk—but they have not a corresponding effect on
the alvine evacuations. “The operation of the Carlsbad waters, in fact, is
what is called ‘<i>alterative</i>,’ or ‘<i>deobstruent</i>;’ and as such they are applicable
to a long list of maladies arising from congestion or obstruction
in the abdominal organs, particularly the liver, spleen, mesentery and other
glandular viscera, attended by debility of the stomach, heart-burn, acidity,
distention, eructations, constipation, jaundice, biliary concretions, hypochondriasis,
hæmorrhoids, head-aches, giddiness, gouty feelings, cutaneous
eruptions, scrofula, and urinary obstructions.”<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>This is an encouraging picture, but I have no reason to consider it as
overcharged. Dr. De Carro observes, that it is impossible to explain the
<i>modus operandi</i> of such simple and minute ingredients on the human
organism. “Whoever, he remarks, has experienced a crisis (called also
the spa fever—the bad-sturm, &amp;c.) in his own person, will never doubt the
power of the Carlsbad waters.”</p>

<p>Dr. De C. compares the action of the Carlsbad waters on the human
frame to a good filter that separates all impurities from the constitution.</p>

<p>“Hypochondriacal affections appear nowhere under more various forms
than at Carlsbad; and the misanthropic and pusillanimous feelings of those
unfortunate beings, passing, without known motives, from hope to despondency,
from moroseness to exaltation, deserve the greatest indulgence and
sympathy. When we see so many hepatic and splenetic patients whose temper
depends entirely on the state of their abdominal functions, we feel disposed
to forgive the materialism of the ancients, who placed the seat of so
many passions in the liver; we remember unwillingly the <i>Fervens difficili
bile tumet jecur</i>, the <i>jecur ulcerosum</i> of Horace, as synonymous of <i>jealousy</i>
and <i>violent love</i>, and we understand how they could say that men <i>splene
rident, felle irascunt, jecore amant, pulmone jactantur, corde sapiunt</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>The worthy Doctor deplores the disappointments and mortifications
which many invalids from far distant lands annually experience here,
when they learn, to their grief and dismay, that the mineral waters
are totally inapplicable to their maladies! They have then only the
alternative of laying their bones in Bohemian soil, or undertaking another
long, fatiguing, and expensive journey towards their native land. Dr. De
Carro blames the ignorance which prevails among the faculty generally,
respecting the medicinal properties of the Carlsbad and other spas. But
the spa doctors themselves, and spa tourists, are not entirely blameless.
The exaggerated accounts that are published respecting the <i>miraculous</i>
powers of almost every spa in Germany, are quite sufficient to mislead
practitioners and patients who have no personal knowledge of these
vaunted springs. One great object of the present volume is the attempt
to sift the grain from the chaff, or to filter these waters and depurate them
of their gross crudities and absurdities.</p>

<p>“The Carlsbad waters (says Dr. De C.) are detrimental when there are
any symptoms of inflammation, congestion, or vertigo present. If these
exist on the arrival of the invalid, they must be removed before he takes the
waters; if they occur during the use of the waters, these last must be
immediately discontinued.”</p>

<p>Dr. De C. observes, that these springs are detrimental in phthisis or any
grade of pulmonary complaint—and that, in general, they aggravate
<i>organic</i> diseases of all kinds, and hasten their march. Here then is a rule
which applies to many of the spas besides Carlsbad—namely, that the constitution
should be free from inflammation, congestion, and structural
changes in any organ, before the waters can be safely taken. Dropsical
affections, even where no organic disease can be detected as their cause,
are aggravated by the Carlsbad waters. Dr. De C. relates a melancholy
instance of a nobleman who was sent there from a great distance—only to
die of dropsy.</p>

<p>In chlorotic and amenorrhœal disorders, Carlsbad waters are beneficial;
not so much from the minute quantity of iron they contain, as from their
stimulant and deobstruent qualities. Females ought not to use these
waters at all times.</p>

<p>A painful complaint which often presents itself at Carlsbad is <i>biliary
calculi</i>. Dr. De C. thinks that the waters are almost specific in such
cases. He lately attended an invalid who had come from a great distance
to Carlsbad. On the third day of using the waters a prodigious number
of gall-stones, of all sizes, were expelled. He has often found gravel to
be expelled from the kidneys and bladder during the use of these waters;
but he does not vouch for their <i>lithontriptic</i> powers—that is, their power
of <i>dissolving</i> urinary calculi, although this quality has been attributed to
them by some physicians.</p>

<p>It is in chronic gout, especially of the wandering and misplaced kind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
that the Carlsbad waters have acquired considerable renown, disputing the
palm with Wisbaden itself. It is in general necessary to take some chalybeate
waters, in such cases, after the course at Carlsbad is completed. It
is acknowledged by Sir John De Carro, that more than one visitation to
Carlsbad will be necessary in gouty affections of any standing.</p>

<p>In the nervous tremors occasioned by quicksilver, these waters have been
found very beneficial, both internally and externally.</p>

<h4>THE CARLSBAD STURM, OR CRISIS.</h4>

<p>From the age of 35 years, Dr. De Carro was subject to severe attacks
of gout, each attack generally lasting ten or fifteen days, followed by much
debility, with great tenderness of the feet. The intervals were of various
duration—sometimes months—sometimes years. The complaint is hereditary
in his family for four generations. About fifteen years ago (1825) one
of the paroxysms ceased suddenly on the third day, followed by alarming
symptoms—difficulty of breathing—irritation about the throat—total loss
of sleep—copious muco-purulent expectoration, of an acrid and acid taste—rapid
emaciation—cadaverous expression of countenance—and all the
symptoms of approaching laryngeal phthisis. From these, however, he
gradually emerged; but a sense of constriction in the trachea remained,
occasioning loss of voice and many uncomfortable feelings. In April 1826,
many of the symptoms above-mentioned returned, with considerable violence,
and the Dr. removed from Vienna to Carlsbad. The waters of this
spa are not beneficial in pulmonic complaints generally, but Dr. De C. considered
his own malady as misplaced gout, and he commenced the waters
on the 17th of May, at the Neubrunn. “During the first three days he
felt no effect whatever. He had been unable to get higher than seven goblets
daily; but, on the fourth day, he felt as if he were drunk—lost his appetite—staggered
on his legs—had indistinct vision—burning cheeks—excited
and agitated circulation—overwhelming drowsiness, and total inability to
read or write. These violent symptoms continued for three days, and
were <i>much mitigated by copious evacuations</i>, (tres soulagé par des evacuations
copieuses) and, the storm having subsided, he continued the course of
waters for six weeks, without further inconvenience. The bowels became
regular, and there was a copious but fætid secretion from the kidneys
during the whole time. All the symptoms of misplaced gout disappeared.”<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Dr. De C. observes that, had he not been a physician, he would have
looked upon the above symptoms as forerunners of apoplexy. I am quite
confident that they were so, and that the apoplexy was warded off by the
“copious evacuations” that were procured, whether by nature or art. I
have seen several instances of this “<span class="smcap">bad-sturm</span>,” and have no doubt of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
being owing to some inflammatory action going on in some part of the
body (as was clearly the case in the present instance), or to the neglect of
aperient medicine taken in conjunction with the waters. The misplaced
gout, such as Dr. De C. presented, is readily relieved by saline aperients,
with small doses of colchicum and counter-irritation, without the risk of
the “<span class="smcap">bad-sturm</span>,” which is a violent conflict between the constitution and
the remedy. It is when the complaint is quiescent, and all inflammatory
symptoms removed, that the Carlsbad and other mineral waters are
beneficial.</p>

<p>Dr. De Carro has a short chapter on the East and West Indian invalids
who resort to Carlsbad annually, for the relief of broken-down constitutions,
and especially for affections of the liver, the spleen, and for the consequences
of intermittent and remittent fevers contracted within the
tropics. The worthy doctor, who has the usual dread of mercury, so widely
infecting the Continental faculty, seems to hint pretty broadly that many
of the Anglo-Oriental and Occidental diseases, are as much owing to the
remedies as to the climate. Be this as it may, he gives the pagoda-complexioned
gentry great hopes of benefit from the waters of the Sprudel.</p>

<p>The regime laid down by Dr. De Carro, is rather more liberal than by
some of his confreres at the German Spas. Breakfast should not be taken
till an hour after finishing the last goblet. Besides the exercise which is
taken while drinking the waters, he recommends half an hour’s promenade
after leaving the spring, if the patient be not too fatigued. The breakfast
itself may be coffee, tea, or chocolate, according to the habits or inclinations
of the invalid. Coffee is rather hazardous where there is any tendency
to inflammatory action in the constitution. The bread and the
cream are excellent at Carlsbad. <i>Dejeuners a la fourçhette</i> are inadmissible
here. The dinners at Carlsbad are very abstemious, as the <span class="smcap">Traiteurs</span>
are obliged to regulate them by the orders of the faculty. They present
no temptation to commit excesses. A very temperate use of plain and
well-boiled vegetables is permitted. Salads, cheese, herrings, anchovies,
and all raw fruit are strictly forbidden. The supper should be a little soup—and
the time of going to bed is ten o’clock at the latest. Gambling is
forbidden. The beer of the place, and light wines are permitted. The
Bohemian, Hungarian, and Austrian wines are wholesome; but those of
the Rhine, the Rhone, and Moselle may be used. It is recommended to
keep the mind tranquil and contented! Alas! the prescription is easily
written, but what pharmacy can supply the drug?</p>

<p>The season at Carlsbad extends from the first of May till the 30th of
September. It is divided into three epochs. From the 1st of May till
the 15th June, those who love quietude, economy, and health, will go to
the spa. From the latter period till the middle of August, when the air
is nearly as hot as the waters, <span class="smcap">Carlsbad</span> swarms, like a bee-hive, with
legions of invalids and their friends, who lead, as Dr. De Carro says, “une<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
vie bruyante,” and pay handsomely for their accommodations. The last six
weeks, like the first, are more quiet, cool, and reasonable in expense.
Those, too, who are anxious to have long interviews with their doctors,
and pour out all their complaints into his attentive ear, will avoid the hot
and fashionable season, and prefer the beginning or end.</p>

<p>It is remarked by Dr. De C. that a considerable number of people annually
resort to Carlsbad without any other complaint than constipation of
the bowels, obliging them to be constantly taking aperient medicine.
“The waters of Carlsbad generally establish the regularity of the bowels,
and during their use no aperient medicine whatever should be taken.” As
the causes of constipation are chiefly sedentary avocations, there is little
doubt but that a journey to Bohemia, and the waters of the Sprudel, will
generally obviate this troublesome complaint or inconvenience; but I
greatly doubt whether the Carlsbad waters will prevent its return, when
the causes come again into operation.</p>

<p>Here our worthy author enters his protest against the codes of minute
instructions which are often issued by far distant practitioners, who have
no personal knowledge of the spas, for the guidance of the patients, and
by which they are often led into great errors or even dangers, by neglecting
to consult some physician on the spot, respecting the proper waters to
drink and the best mode of taking them. All indeed that the distant
physician ought to do is, to investigate well the complaint, and recommend
such spa as he deems proper, leaving the details of application to the discretion
of the medical practitioner on the spot.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Since the publication of Dr. De Carro, many monographs on the Carlsbad
waters have appeared by different authors, some of which have been noticed
in the annual <span class="smcap">Almanack</span> of Carlsbad, composed and published by Dr. De
Carro himself. This little annual is of a miscellaneous nature, combining
amusement with information, and never omitting <i>one particular</i> item—a
list of all the visitors, with their titles, avocations, rank, and <i>celebrity</i>—where
there is any fame. It may be as well to glance at some of these
monographs, so as to pick out as much information from them as we can.</p>

<p>Dr. Bamberg, of Berlin, published a paper on the modern practice of
Carlsbad, in the year 1835, from which I shall collect a few facts or opinions.
Dr. B. was astonished to find at least ten drinkers at the <span class="smcap">Neubrunn</span> or
<span class="smcap">Muhlbrunn</span> for one at the “Old Man of the Valley,” the splendid <span class="smcap">Sprudel</span>.
The Theresebrunn too, was not less frequented than her sister Naiads.
It appears that a spa-doctor, now dead, had denounced the Sprudel as a most
dangerous water on account of its high temperature, and prejudicing the
visitors against it, by alleging, when other arguments failed, that it mounted
up to the head with the same force and velocity with which it springs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
from its hidden source! The prejudice was erroneous. All the waters
are from the same source, and the temperature of the Sprudel is generally
as low as that of the others before it reaches the stomach. The Carlsbad
doctors, however, are often greatly teazed by the directions brought by
visitors from their own physicians, respecting the particular springs which
they are to use. Some prejudice still hangs over the Sprudel, and that it
is generally looked upon as of superior power to the others, is proved by
the character of the drinkers there. The sick are more seriously ill—their
aspects more sinister—and their figures more demonstrative of organic
diseases at the Sprudel than elsewhere. But fashion comes in to the aid
of prejudice. The Archipelago formed by the Neubrunn, Muhlbrunn, and
Theresebrunn, is decorated so elegantly, and the temperature so drinkable,
as the water rises from its source, that we need not wonder at the multitudes
that crowd around them, especially when the physicians assure their
patients that the waters of these fountains are precisely the same as the
Sprudel.</p>

<p>The Sprudel possesses two very curious and clashing properties—that
of creating stony concretions where they did not previously exist, and of
dissolving them when already formed—like the famous sword of antiquity,
whose rust healed the wound inflicted by its edge. The Carlsbad waters
have the power of dissolving calculi in the human bladder, and are much
resorted to for that purpose. Dr. Bigel, of Warsaw, has published his
own case, in a letter to Dr. De Carro, some particulars of which may here
be stated.</p>

<p>Dr. B. became affected with calculus after the age of 60 years, having
previously passed several renal calculi, and was operated on by the lithotritic
apparatus. The stone was smashed, but several of the fragments
could not be discharged afterwards. He was then conveyed in a kind of
litter many hundreds of miles to Carlsbad, where he took the waters under
the direction of Dr. De Carro. On the third day of taking the Theresebrunn,
and that in small quantities, Dr. B. became affected with fever,
such as he experienced after the operation of lithotrity. This was relieved
by copious perspirations. Returning to the waters, a similar attack of
fever was kindled up on the fifth day—but with it the expulsion of several
fragments of stone, and much solace in the organ. The fragments, which
had hitherto been of a dark brown colour, were now white, and their surfaces
smooth and polished. The white colour was found to penetrate to
some depth from the surface. Dr. B. changed from one spring to another
of higher temperature, till he finished with the Sprudel. At each of the
sources he passed pieces of stone, and after their disappearance for a fortnight,
the bladder was explored, and no more calculi were discoverable.
All uneasiness in the bladder ceased from this time.</p>

<p>Dr. Creutzburg made some experiments on urinary calculi subjected to
the action of the Carlsbad waters, and the results appear to be favourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
to the idea that these waters are beneficial in calculous complaints. And
now, when lithotrity is so frequently employed, instead of lithotomy, these
waters may prove eminently useful in polishing and softening the fragments
left after the operation.</p>

<p>But the waters of Carlsbad do not limit their powers to the solution or
expulsion of vesical calculi; they have done wonders in people afflicted
with biliary concretions. Dr. De Carro had a patient, aged 40 years, who
evacuated daily, by means of the waters, not only large quantities of
gravel, but numbers of gall-stones, of various shapes and sizes. Liver-complaints
occupy a considerable figure among the maladies which are
treated at Carlsbad—and biliary calculi are very frequently observed there.
Dr. De Carro has related numerous instances where the baths and the
waters of Carlsbad have appeared to dislodge the gall-stones, and carry
them off by the bowels.</p>

<p>The Carlsbad baths, which are now much more used than formerly, often
bring forward masked gout, rheumatism, or neuralgic pains that had lain
more or less dormant in the constitution for months or years.</p>

<p>Before quitting these celebrated waters, I must take a short notice of a
little work just published by a rising young physician of Carlsbad, whose
acquaintance I had the pleasure of making there.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">(<i>From the Medico-Chirurgical Review.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">Geschichte von Karlsbad. Von Dr. Hlawaczek.—History of Carlsbad.</p>

</div>

<p>The learned author gives a most elaborate account of almost every work
that has been published on these famous waters, since their discovery by
the Emperor Charles IV. in the sixteenth century. His book is, in short,
a catalogue raisonnée of the writings of his predecessors. The few practical
observations contained in it may be thus stated:</p>

<p>The medicinal powers of the Carlsbad waters are the following:</p>

<p>1. They invigorate the primæ viæ, and dislodge from them all impurities
and accumulations. Hence in various forms of dyspepsia, arising from a
sedentary life, from torpor of the bowels, &amp;c. they are especially useful;
also in chronic jaundice, obstinate head-aches accompanied with constipation,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>With such patients the use of the Carlsbad waters often act as an
emetic for the first day or two.—Corpulent indolent persons, who feed too
much and take little exercise, are always benefitted.</p>

<p>In all obstructed and infarcted states of the abdominal viscera, the use
of the Carlsbad waters may be recommended. Hence, in many cases of
hypochondriasis and hæmorrhoids, they are beneficial: also in enlargements
of the liver, spleen, and mesenteric glands.</p>

<p>In addition to these maladies, we may enumerate many cases of amenorrhœa
and dysmenorrhœa—diseases which are so often dependent upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
accumulations in the bowels and general torpor and plethora of the
system.</p>

<p>2. The Carlsbad waters have the effect of freeing the blood of acrimonious
particles, either by neutralising and discharging them out of the body, or
by causing a metastasis and derivation of them to the joints or to the skin.
Hence in various forms of <i>internal</i> gout and rheumatism, they are singularly
useful; the disease being often drawn from the internal viscus which
may happen to be affected to some outward part.</p>

<p>3. The Carlsbad waters cleanse the urinary passages of calculous deposits.</p>

<p>And lastly, they often effect a cure in a number of anomalous diseases,
whose causes are not known, and to which indeed, a name cannot be
given; as, for example, loss of power and feeling in the limbs, a tendency
to syncope followed by cramps, some cases of epilepsy and asthma; also
in certain disturbances of the mental functions. In all these cases, the
Carlsbad waters seem to act as an <i>alterative</i>.</p>

<p>The venerable <i>Hufeland</i> published in 1815, a treatise on the chief medicinal
springs in Germany. He recommends the use of the Carlsbad
waters in cases of constipation, tympanites, incipient disorganisation of
the stomach and bowels and other abdominal viscera, more especially of
the liver, of chronic jaundice, of congestion of the mesenteric and portal
veins; also in nervous ailments, as amaurosis, hypochondriasis, and in various
forms of calculous disease. He also strongly recommends them in
most of the forms of gout. The Carlsbad waters, in addition to their
purgative qualities, are possessed of remarkable alterative powers, so that
often they effect quite a change in the state of the blood and other fluids
of the body, depriving them of all acrimonious and hurtful particles, and
restoring them to a condition of health. Hence their striking utility in
numerous cases of cachexia, which are irremediable by ordinary medical
treatment.—<span class="smcap">Hlawaczek.</span></p>

<h3 id="VALETUDINARIUM">VALETUDINARIUM.</h3>

<p>It is often more easy to ascertain the internal condition of the body
through the medium of external phenomena, than that of the mind through
the physiognomy of the countenance. To the experienced observer, the
complexion, the expression, the eye, the gait, the tone of voice, the figure,
the proportion of the different parts of the body, and many other indications
incapable of description, convey very authentic information respecting
the condition of organs and structures that are far removed from sight. It
is in a great <span class="smcap">sanitarium</span> like this, where invalids are gathered from all
quarters of the world, that a young physician, under the guidance of
an old one, might beneficially study the <i>physiognomy</i> of diseases. For,
although the greater number of spas have much that is common, both as
respects the waters and the maladies for which they are taken, yet each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
spa, or at least, each class of spas, exhibits some characteristic features
among the mass of visitors, indicative of the maladies which led them to
the Hygeian fountains of the place. Thus it is impossible to stand long
at the <span class="smcap">Fontaine Elisée</span> of Aix-la-Chapelle, without discerning a large
sprinkling of cutaneous complaints, however carefully they may be concealed
by the wearers of them. It is in vain that—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Wrapp’d in his robe white <span class="smcap">Lepra</span> hides his stains,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the features of the <span class="smcap">leper</span> disclose the worm that torments him by day
and by night. The French and Germans are universally imbued with the
doctrine that the repression of a certain malady, which has got the musical
soubriquet of “<span class="smcap">Scotch-fiddle</span>,” is the cause of half the evils to which
flesh is heir. On this account, the continental folks have a great longing,
or rather a violent <i>itching</i> for sulphureous waters. The slightest odour of
sulphuretted hydrogen gas in a newly-discovered spring, is a real treasure—and
in the old ones, it is sure to preserve reputation to endless ages!</p>

<p>The neighbouring mineral source—<span class="smcap">Spa</span>—together with <span class="smcap">Schwalbach</span>,
<span class="smcap">Brockenau</span>, <span class="smcap">Bocklet</span>, and other chalybeate springs, attract a different
class of votaries—namely, the pallid, the debilitated, the leucophlegmatic—those,
in fact, who have been sucked, and left bloodless by vampyre
diseases.</p>

<p>The emblem of <span class="smcap">Wisbaden</span> might be a swelled and gouty foot—that
of <span class="smcap">Wildbad</span> a crutch, or a hobbling paralytic invalid—<span class="smcap">Kissengen</span>, the
tumid liver and green fat—<span class="smcap">Marienbad</span>, the paunch of Falstaff, and the
jaundiced eye.</p>

<p>But <span class="smcap">Carlsbad</span> presents a greater medley than any of the other spas that
I have visited. When we contemplate, even for a single morning, the
crowds that surround the Sprudel alone, presenting specimens of almost
every human infirmity, not in solitary cases, but often in trains of twenties
or thirties in succession—when we consider that, in these various specimens,
there are many that are of a diametrically opposite nature to each
other—yet all cured or relieved by an upheaving fountain that never varies
in temperature, taste, or composition—doubts may well arise whether there
is not some truth in the sarcastic remark of an eminent philosopher,—that
“there are more false <i>facts</i> than false <i>theories</i> in physic.”—But there is
something to be said <span class="smcap">per contra</span>. 1st. Many complaints which are
thought and believed to be cured by mineral waters, are only <i>relieved pro
tempore</i>—and the contradiction seldom or never appears. 2d. Many different
diseases are produced by the <i>same causes</i> acting on different constitutions.
Thus luxurious living and idleness will, in one person, induce
gout—in a second, hæmorrhoids—in a third, liver complaint—in a fourth,
rupture of a bloodvessel in the lungs—in a fifth, congestion in the brain—in
a sixth, paralysis—in a seventh, stone in the kidney or bladder,—and
the list might be far extended. Now, if the same cause or class of causes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
produce such a number of different maladies; there is nothing unreasonable
in the supposition that the same remedy, or class of remedies, may be useful
in abating or even removing those varied disorders.</p>

<p>3d. With the exception of a few specific remedies, such as mercury,
sulphur, colchicum, and ergot, with the real nature of whose physiological
operation on the human frame little is known, almost all the other medicinal
agents act through the medium of the digestive organs, the liver, the
kidneys, and the skin. Now, the mineral waters of such spas as Wisbaden,
Kissengen, Marienbad, Carlsbad, &amp;c. act through these organs also,
and contain the elements of many of our most efficient remedies. They
have, besides, great advantages over ordinary medicines at home, in consequence
of the exercise of travelling, the change of air, and the alteration
of habits that precede the course of the waters.</p>

<p>4. Through what channels do the noxious <i>physical</i> agents enter the
constitution and produce disease? Through the digestive organs and skin,
without doubt,—to which may be added the lungs, which may imbibe the
principles of disorder with the oxygen from the air we breathe.</p>

<p>5. But there is a great class of <i>moral</i> causes of diseases, acting on the
body through the medium of the mind—a class so extensive that <span class="smcap">Plato</span>
considered it to be the origin of all corporeal maladies!</p>

<p>6. Against these moral agents the great spas possess powerful auxiliary
counter-agents, <i>as preventives</i>, in the form of amusements on the spot
and abstraction from cares. They also present the means of removing
(if removeable) the effects which these moral causes have already inflicted
on the bodily frame.</p>

<p>7. The far greater number of physical remedies act by altering and improving
disordered functions and secretions—by evacuation—and by
imparting tone to debilitated organs or the whole constitution.</p>

<p>8. It must be allowed that mineral waters contain, to a very considerable
extent, the requisite ingredients for fulfilling one or all of the foregoing
indications.</p>

<p>9. It is often found to be beneficial to combine tonics, alteratives, and
aperients in the same formula or prescription, in order that the three indications
alluded to, may be simultaneously accomplished.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> It is undeniable
that some of the spas contain within themselves this combination of chalybeates,
aperients, and alteratives, either of which ingredients can be increased
at pleasure on the spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>10. The medicinal agents in the mineral waters, though in much smaller
quantities than when given in prescriptions, have a much better chance of
success, in consequence of their being so largely diluted by the hand of
Nature, and the temperature of the diluent being so very high, in most of
the springs.</p>

<p>11. The early hours, and the exercise taken while drinking mineral
waters, have powerful influence in promoting their salutary operation.
How many invalids, in England, would start from their beds at five o’clock
in the morning, to drink salt and water till seven or eight o’clock, using
their limbs all the time in locomotion? very few!</p>

<p>12. The warm bathing, which generally precedes or accompanies the
drinking of the waters, has also great effect in augmenting the medicinal
agency of the waters taken internally. The circulation is drawn to the
surface—the insensible perspiration augmented—and various internal
organs sympathise with the skin and are relieved from habitual congestion.</p>

<p>13. The habit of early rising, which is unavoidable at the great spas,
leads to many other good habits. Early meals and early bed-going follow
of course, and of consequence. The excursions in the middle of the day,
undertaken while devoid of care, and free from business, contribute not a
little to the efficacy of the spas, and to soundness of repose at night.</p>

<p>14. When I observed that many of the German spas combined tonic,
with aperient, and alterative qualities, I by no means averred that these
qualities were always well proportioned for all complaints and various constitutions.
On the contrary, they are often very deficient in one or other
of these qualities—and it is by overlooking this defect, and trusting solely
to the remedial agency of the waters, that continental physicians commit
a grand mistake—especially in the treatment of British patients.</p>

<p>15. The digestive organs of our continental neighbours are habitually
in a far more tender and excitable condition than those of our countrymen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
in consequence of their greasy and sloppy food, and the poverty and acidity
of their wines and other drink. They cannot, therefore, bear medicines
of any strength, without great suffering. Relying on identity of constitution,
the mineral waters are often administered ineffectually by foreign
physicians to the people of these islands. These last are washed and
drenched, from day to day, and from week to week, while the glandular
organs (the liver in particular) not directly affected by the waters, become
torpid in function, and vitiated in their secretions. Hence it is that, after
a week or a fortnight, much derangement takes place in the digestive organs—febrile
irritation is set up—the nervous system is impaired—and
then, when the patient declares that the waters are disagreeing with him,
the <span class="smcap">spa doctor</span> consoles him with the information that the spa-fever or
crisis has come, and, if he lives through it, he will be much better than
before it commenced! All this, in nine cases out of ten, might be prevented
by taking a small dose of blue pill—a couple of grains, for instance—over
night. In this case, a much smaller quantity of the waters would
be sufficient in the morning, and the liver and other glands would be
roused to simultaneous action with the bowels. The physicians of Cheltenham
and Leamington act on this plan, and render the course of waters far
more beneficial than they otherwise would be. The crisis or spa-fever
appears to me an act of salutary rebellion, on the part of Nature, against
the injudicious employment of the waters, and an effort to restore the equilibrium
of function among the great organs, which equilibrium has been
disturbed by the waters themselves.</p>

<p>16. It is a well-known fact that soldiers, sailors, and even civilians, will
recover from illness much sooner in a public hospital than in their own
homes—although attended by the same physician or surgeon. The same
applies to infirmities of mind as well as of body. The individual who
becomes insane, has infinitely less chance of recovery at home amongst
his friends, than among strangers in an asylum. A great valetudinarium,
like the spas, comes under the same rule. How is this to be accounted
for? I have heard the aphorism of Rochefaucault quoted in explanation,
viz. “that we derive pleasure from the sight of misery and suffering in
others, even when they are our dearest friends.” From long acquaintance
with human nature, I venture to say that, in this celebrated aphorism—or
rather sophism—the author of it only stated <i>half</i> a fact, and drew from
that half fact a <i>false</i> inference. The emotion which we involuntarily experience
at the sight or the intelligence of misfortune or affliction in others,
whether strangers or friends, is not unmixed—but a compound of <i>commiseration</i>
for the afflicted, and a feeling of <i>secret satisfaction</i> (magnified by
Rochefaucault into <i>pleasure</i>) at our own immunity from the evil. Two
sailors are on the lee yard-arm furling the mainsail in a tempest. The ship
lurches—the yard-arm is swept by a wave—and one of the sailors is torn
from his hold, and plunged into the deep. Will the French philosopher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
persuade us that the seaman, who clings to the yard and escapes death,
feels <i>pleasure</i>, unmixed with sorrow, at the sight of his drowning mess-mate?
The poet, who saw and described a catastrophe identical with
the above, but on a larger scale, was far from entertaining the sentiment
of the philosopher.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Bereft of power to help, their comrades see</div>
<div class="verse">Their late companions die beneath their lee,</div>
<div class="verse">With fruitless <i>sorrow</i> their lost state <i>bemoan</i>.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>17. But there are other and adequate causes assignable for the more rapid
recovery of health in public places of resort for invalids, than in private
life. Man is the creature of habit; and habit results chiefly from imitation.
In a great watering-place, we acquire, or at least comply with, habits
which we would not attempt at home. How many delicate and fashionable
invalids would start from their couches at sun-rise every morning, in London,
and drink repeated draughts of nauseous compounds before breakfast?
How many would dine at one, instead of seven o’clock? How many
would retire to bed at nine o’clock, instead of midnight or later? How
many gourmands and Bacchanalians, in England, would comply with the
rigid rules of abstemiousness enjoined by the spa doctors, and which they
dare not infringe, lest the disobedience might render the waters useless, or
even injurious?</p>

<p>The revolution in social, but insalutary habits alone, would cure half
the <i>disorders</i> for which the aristocratic valetudinarian flies to the spas. If
the maxim of Rochefaucault, too, have any foundation in truth, what a
prodigious source of pleasure must the spa-goer find in the different
watering-places, where he daily contemplates almost the whole of the
moving mass of mortals around him labouring under more or less of bodily
suffering! But, admitting the less humiliating explanation which I have
attempted of the philosophical maxim, the result will not be materially
different. Every one affected by <i>disorders</i> at all curable, will see many
around him who are evidently afflicted by <i>diseases</i> beyond the reach of
remedy. While commiserating the fate of their neighbours, they have a
pleasing consciousness and assurance that they themselves are not in such
a hopeless condition. As for the victims doomed to an early grave, <i>they</i>
never despair. They see daily recoveries going on around them—and
<span class="smcap">hope</span>, “that comes to all,” does not withhold its balmy influence even from
them! The resounding Sprudel is pouring forth its healing waters for
the incurable as well as for the curable, whilst the veil of mystery that
hangs over its origin and source, exaggerates, on the well-known principle,
“<i>omne ignotum pro magnifico</i>,” the virtues of its miraculous qualities!
The season of the year in which the journey is made and the waters
taken, is not a little favourable to the recovery of health, and, combined
with the sanguine expectations of recruited vigour and emancipation from
sufferings, gives wonderful efficacy to the spa.</p>

<h3 id="GASTEIN">GASTEIN, commonly called WILDBAD GASTEIN.</h3>

<p>Gastein, Pfeffers, and Teplitz are triplet sisters of the same qualities,
physical and medicinal. They are so pure that they may be, and are used
as spring water for drinking and culinary purposes. The locality of Gastein
is only inferior in romantic scenery to that of Pfeffers. It is much
superior to that of Wildbad. It is situated on the frontiers of the Duchy
of Salzburg and Carinthia, in the midst of mountains ten thousand feet in
height, and its fervid springs, several in number, rise on the borders, and
in the very middle of a cataract that foams and flies over a precipice, with
a noise like thunder, into an abyss of nearly 300 feet in depth. It is the
little river <span class="smcap">Ache</span> that descends from the mountains, and forms the striking
feature of the landscape at Gastein, which was once a place of wealth and
consequence, by reason of the neighbouring mines; but is now only a valetudinarium
for the recovery of health. The people of this neighbourhood
are of remarkably robust and vigorous constitutions, well made, and
handsome in appearance—pastoral in their habits, and simple in their
manners.</p>

<p>There are six available springs, besides those which rise in the bed of
the torrent. The highest is the Prince’s Well, near the Chateau, and
which is a very abundant source—furnishing 13,680 cubic feet of water in
the 24 hours—the temperature being always 37° of Reamur, or 115°
Fahrenheit. It is used conjointly with the water of an adjoining spring,
called the “<span class="smcap">Doctor’s Well</span>,” which is one or two degrees higher in temperature.
This last furnishes 3,600 cubic feet of water in the 24 hours.
These two sources supply, by means of a pump, the new baths near the
Chateau. Another is named after the Emperor Francis—and another still,
that of the Hospital, at the foot of the Richeuibein, throwing up the astonishing
quantity of 72,720 cubic feet of hot water in the day and night!
All these springs are on the right bank of the <span class="smcap">Ache</span>; but there are other
sources on the left bank also—the aggregate of all being upwards of one
hundred thousand cubic feet of mineral water in the 24 hours.</p>

<p>There are ten or a dozen establishments for bathing at Gastein—some
of them not the most splendid or convenient in the world. The practice
of bathing in common is not very unusual here, and consequently upwards
of 150 people may bathe at the same time. The complaint of Dr. Granville,
that the baths are seldom completely emptied during the day, is not
without foundation in truth. Gastein is now probably the only place
where men and women bathe together.</p>

<p>“The common bath (says Dr. Streinz) in which gentlemen and ladies
assemble together, contains 365 cubic feet of water, and requires nearly
four hours to fill it. It will accommodate fifteen or sixteen persons, who
can walk about in the water, or rest upon seats which are fixed there for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the purpose. At each side of the bath there is a large dressing-room, one
for the men, the other for the women. Around the bath runs a gallery,
where the friends or acquaintances of the bathers can assemble, and enter
into conversation with them.”<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>It is quite useless to go into minute topographical details. Those who
repair to Gastein will not need them—and those who stay at home will
not read them. We shall therefore proceed to the properties of the waters
themselves. It has been already observed that they are purer than any
spring water, and so clear that you can discern particles of gravel at a
depth of some feet. They spring from the earth without noise or bubbling.
In certain damp states of the atmosphere, and preceding rains, some people
have perceived a slight odour of sulphuretted hydrogen gas in these
springs; but it is so questionable that they may be used as common beverage.
They suffer no change, when exposed to the air, nor deposit any
matter. Their temperature has been stated. When polished silver is immersed
for four or five hours in these springs it becomes tinged of a brownish
yellow colour, not easily effaced. The water leaves incrustations on
wood or other articles exposed to its action, which incrustations are soft,
astringent, and bitter to the taste. These waters have a remarkably vivifying
effect on flowers, fruits, and vegetables exposed to their influence.
In a pint of the water there is about 2⅔ grs. of solid matters, chiefly sulphate
and muriate of soda, with a minute trace of iron. When brought
near the magnetic needle it draws the loadstone sensibly towards it, which
quality diminishes as the water cools. It has been ascertained that the
Gastein water is composed of three, instead of two atoms of hydrogen to
one atom of oxygen.</p>

<p>These waters are used as common baths—vapour-baths—and taken internally.
The douches are also much employed. Their remedial powers,
seeing that they have no chemical properties worth notice, have called
forth much speculation—the conclusion, however, being, that the cause of
this medicinal agency is veiled from human ken. This being the case, our
object is to investigate the actual effects of waters so pure on the human
frame. This, which is mere matter of observation, is far from being an
easy matter. Spa doctors become unintentionally prejudiced—and spa
tourists are often credulous—while patients themselves are often deceived—attributing
virtues to the waters which sprang from various other causes
that received no credit at the time. It is affirmed by Dr. Streinz and
others, that the waters of Gastein, whether used internally, or externally,
or both, produce a certain degree of excitation in the human constitution,
evinced by some increase of temperature in the body—of power in the
muscles—of animation in the eye and countenance—of clearness in the
complexion—of acceleration in the circulation—of activity in the nervous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
system—of exhilaration of spirits. Those who bathe in them experience
(as they say) unusual pleasurable sensations. The surface of the body
becomes soft and smooth, with a slight but pleasant pricking, and sometimes
a minute vesicular eruption. Dr. Granville’s description of the
effects of the Gastein baths, however, is directly the reverse of Dr. Streinz,
who observed them so long in others, and experienced them in his own
person.</p>

<p>“The effect (says Dr. G.) produced by the water on the skin of the
hands during the first ten minutes of immersion in it was curious. The
bath corrugated and crisped it as if the hands had been held in very hot
water for a considerable time; and on passing my hand all over the body,
previously to the skin of the fingers becoming crisp—in fact almost immediately
after going into the bath—instead of gliding smoothly and oilily
down it, as at Wildbad, it felt ruvid, and the two surfaces seemed to meet
with resistance, as if a third body, slightly rough, like the finest sand, lay
between them.”</p>

<p>Here then we have two physicians giving diametrically opposite accounts
of the physical phenomena produced by the same waters—shewing how
little dependence can be placed on individual descriptions—the said phenomena
varying according to the temperament, state of health, or even
temper of mind of the personal observer!</p>

<p>It is stated by the German physicians that, after the third or fourth bath,
some indisposition is usually felt—some giddiness about the head, and a
relaxation, or sense of weakness in the limbs. These symptoms disappear
in a day or two by repose and abstinence. The use of these waters renders
people more susceptible of atmospheric impressions, of the electric kind,
especially before or during a storm, accompanied by a sense of prostration
or exhaustion, and heaviness about the head, with depression of spirits.
The internal exhibition of these waters promotes the action of the bowels,
and still more of the kidneys, attended by increase of appetite. The
deposits of this water are extolled as applications to old wounds and inveterate
ulcers.</p>

<p>“Long and multiplied experience (says Dr. Streinz) has proved that the
bathe of Gastein re-animate the vital powers that were almost extinct—comfort
and give tone to the flabby limbs—communicate new and vivifying
heat to the blood—vigor to the nerves—and, through the medium of the
magnetico-galvanic principle, re-establish the activity of the whole animal
organism. Those who labour under direct debility, are those who have
experienced most benefit from these waters—as those who have lost their
strength from excessive efforts of the mind, large discharges of blood, or
too copious and violent evacuations of any kind—those who have never
perfectly recovered from severe acute diseases—who labour under disorders
of the digestive organs—tremors—hypochondriasis—hysteria—neuralgic
pains—inveterate gout and rheumatism—paralysis—contractions—affections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
of the spine—scrofula—mercurial diseases, &amp;c. Their exciting
qualities, however, render it necessary that both patient and physician
should watch their physiological action on the body, and observe a very
mild and abstemious regimen.”</p>

<p>Dr. Granville appears to be quite as confident in the efficacy of the
Gastein waters as Dr. Streinz, Dr. Storch, or any of the most sanguine
of his German brethren.</p>

<p>“I have no more doubt of the power which this mineral spring possesses,
in the diseases for which it has been recommended, than I have of the
effect of bleeding in subduing inflammation.”</p>

<p>My friend’s “grain of faith” is not like that of a mustard-seed—it is
as large as a cocoa-nut! At all events, I cannot swallow it; and entertain
very strong doubts indeed of the efficacy of Gastein water in such a
multiplicity of serious diseases as are comprehended in Dr. Granville’s or
Dr. Streinz’s catalogue. I can easily conceive that these waters, assisted
by the mountain air, the romantic scenery, and the journey to the place,
may produce all the effects which can be expected from such waters as
Pfeffers, Wildbad, and Schlangenbad; but that they can work like magic
I entirely disbelieve.</p>

<h3 id="PRAGUE">PRAGUE.</h3>

<p>Whether we view this ancient capital of Bohemia from the bridge below,
or the monastery above, we must acknowledge that, next to Constantinople,
Prague is the most picturesque city in Europe. It is, however, from the
central arch of the longest bridge in Germany, and certainly the most
<i>sainted</i> one, that we have the finest view of a vast amphitheatre rising tier
above tier, from the broad stream of the Moldau, till the highest ridges
of the precipices seem groaning under the massive piles of buildings that
crown their brows. The huge structure, called the <span class="smcap">Hradschin</span>, the palace
of the Bohemian kings—frowns over endless domes, spires, turrets, minarets,
churches, convents, and cathedrals. The eye comes down at length
to a bridge more holy, though not more handsome, than the Santa Trinita
over the Arno. There are nearly as many saints standing on the parapets
here as there are sinners traversing the body of the bridge! The master
saint (St. John Nepomuck) was a priest, who, refusing to disclose the secrets
of the confessional, was pitched into the Moldau by King Winceslaus for
his contempt of court. But murder will not sleep; and a flickering flame
hovered over the spot where the priest lay in his watery shroud, till he was
discovered, and his body encased in a gorgeous silver shrine, which may
be still seen in the cathedral (enclosed within the Hradschin) and is, perhaps,
the most costly tomb in the world. The silver alone weighs thirty-seven
hundred weight! The body of the sainted priest lies in a crystal
coffin of great value! The lions of Prague would require a volume for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
description, and as Murray has dedicated twenty-seven columns to short
notices of the chief objects of curiosity, I shall not say a word on this
head. Three or four days, or a week, may be well occupied here, and
the environs are very pretty. But it is worthy of notice that, in this beautiful
and picturesque capital of Bohemia, the average duration of life, is
one-third less than in London! The annual mortality in Prague, is one in
twenty-two. In London it is not more than one in thirty-two. The
Jews, who are here, as at Rome, crowded into a low and dirty quarter on
the banks of the river, are longer lived than their tyrannical Christian oppressors.
They are also more prolific.</p>

<p>We spent a few days very pleasantly at Prague; but when preparing
to start for Teplitz, I was horrified at finding that I had lost the receipt
for my passport—and that too, in Austria! The Commissionaire at the
“<span class="smcap">Drei Linden</span>,” seemed even more terrified than myself, and thinking he
would contrive to make a job of the business, I marched off to the Bureau,
and candidly stated the loss I had sustained. The officer, having cast
a scrutinizing glance at me, took down a huge pile of passports, and
soon singled mine out. “Voila, Monsieur, votre passport,” was all he
said, and he never made the least difficulty, or seemed to consider it the
slightest favour, to deliver me the precious document, without producing a
receipt! I say again, and again, the Austrian police is grossly slandered.
They are the most civil and polite on the Continent.</p>

<h3 id="TEPLITZ">TEPLITZ.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></h3>

<p>A long journey of sixty odd miles from Prague, through a country
varied, and often interesting, brings us to the fertile valley of Teplitz studded
with chateaux and villas, and well cultivated. The hills and mountains, for
many miles before we reach Teplitz, are all conical and volcanic. This is
the great <span class="smcap">wash-tub</span> of Germany. What prodigious masses of exuviæ,
suds, and sordes, must annually float down the Elbe to fertilize its shores!
Three great public baths (and now a fourth, at Schoneau) for men, women,
and children, respectively, display an immense number of human beings—all
Adams and Eves without fig-leaves—immersed in water at a temperature
sometimes of 114° of Fahrenheit, inhaling a dense steam, through
which you could formerly have scarcely distinguished them—panting,
perspiring, and streaming blood from scarifications on their backs to prevent
their brains from being torn up by the excited circulation! Such
<i>was</i> a picture from which <span class="smcap">Dante</span> might have drawn some of his scenes in
the inferno—except that here, it was not the “<span class="smcap">purgatory</span>” of guilty souls,
but the “expurgatorium,” of unclean bodies.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>The natural temperature of these waters is from 120° to 84°—and the
chief ingredient is carbonate of soda—about two or three grains in the
pint.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The private baths are upwards of eighty in number, in the town,
besides the long range of most elegant new baths in the village of Schonau—decidedly
the most superb bathing-places in Europe, and are in full
request from morn till dewy eve. The water is limpid, and soon after immersion
in a blood-heat temperature, or even lower, the surface of the
body (according to Dr. Granville) becomes rough, rigid, and even wrinkled—a
condition that obtains for some time after leaving the bath.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Perspiration
also is visible on the skin, in big round drops, while the individual is
proceeding to dry and dress. At a higher temperature than that of the
blood—say from 108° to 112° or 114°, the action of the bath on the circulation
and excitability is emphatic, and must often be extremely dangerous.
The excitation first induced, is, and must be followed by a corresponding
degree of depression or exhaustion. The reputation of the Teplitz
baths is probably as much founded on the high temperature at which they
are used, as on the composition of the waters themselves. There ought
to be a mart at Teplitz for the sale of cast-off or second-hand crutches!
“I may state (says Dr. Granville) that the specific virtue of these baths
lies in the power they possess of restoring a cripple—it matters little from
what cause—to perfect motion and elasticity.” Among the list of maladies
that may be perfectly cured here, we have—“all cases of suppressed gout,
chronic rheumatism, diseases of the articulations, paralytic affections, contracted
limbs, old wounds, night pains in the bones, and many other diseases.”—<i>Granville.</i>
Again, Dr. G. avers that—“with proper management
I should not despair of recovering <i>from all his ailments</i>, the most
pitiable object of gouty tyranny.” These are strong assurances. But I
would strenuously caution the victim of suppressed gout respecting the
baths of Teplitz, where the temperature is much higher, though the
ingredients are not much stronger than in the waters of Wildbad or
Pfeffers.</p>

<p>A physician, though young in years, yet of good promise, at Teplitz,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
(Dr. Richter) has written an interesting little work on these waters, and as
it is in French, I would recommend it to the perusal of those who go to
Teplitz for the purpose of bathing. During my stay at this celebrated
spa, I had the advantage of Dr. Richter’s company and experience through
the whole of the bathing establishments, and, through his influence, was
permitted (being only a doctor) to visit the public baths—even those in
which the women were bathing, with the greatest facility. It was at
Schonau that I first saw the female bath in full operation. There might
be about twenty women in the basin, when Dr. R. and myself entered.
There was a slight commotion among the bathers on my first appearance,
which quickly subsided, when my profession was announced and my privilege
explained. Dr. R. published his work in 1840, and it is the most
authentic guide and authority on the subject. I shall here give a condensed
analysis of the small volume.</p>

<p>The various sources of the waters here differ but little in their chemical,
physical, or even thermal properties. The water is limpid, and does not
become turbid by standing, nor does it disengage bubbles of gas or air,
with the exception of the Gartenquelle. The temperature varies from
120° Fahrenheit (the Hauptquelle), to 80° (the Gartenquelle). The
tunnels and reservoirs over which the waters pass become coated with a
brownish-yellow substance, composed chiefly of silex and acidulated oxide
of iron. There are other depositions and incrustations into which the
carbonates of lime and magnesia, as well as manganese and strontia, enter.
In the wells of Steinbad, Stadtbad, and Gartenquelle, there have been observed
various <i>thermal oscillatoria</i>. These waters do not present the same
slowness in boiling and cooling that some other hot spas have evinced.</p>

<p>The great disproportion between the physiological action and the chemical
composition of the Teplitz waters, has given rise to numerous speculations,
and support the grand argument that there is an occult quality in
mineral waters which defies our minutest chemistry. One thing is obvious,
that these waters are alkaline, saline, and chalybeate—and consequently
that they possess, at one and the same time, solvent and tonic qualities,
which are greatly augmented by their temperature. Dr. R. very properly
investigates their physical and physiological action, according as they are
applied hot, warm, tepid, or cold to the body. They may be termed hot,
when above 100°—very hot when approaching to 120°—warm at blood-heat
(98°)—tepid, when under 90°—and cold at the temperature of the earth
or air.</p>

<p>The very hot bath (110° to 115°) produces quickly a general excitation
of the circulation and sensibility, like all other hot waters. It augments
the secretions, ending in considerable perspiration—and followed ultimately
by relaxation in the muscular and fibrous systems, and a general softening
of all the solid parts. When the bath is very warm, we have often, in
addition to the foregoing phenomena, oppression at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
chest—anxiety—palpitation—vertigo—dimness of sight—heaviness about the head—syncope—and
even apoplexy. It need hardly be added, that baths at such a
temperature as to induce the foregoing train of symptoms, are very dangerous,
and hardly ever necessary.</p>

<p>But even at a moderate temperature—96° or 98°—these baths produce,
after a few days, sleeplessness, constipation, great disposition to perspiration,
emaciation, susceptibility to cold or damp, aggravation of gouty or
rheumatic pains, the aching of old wounds, prostration of strength, &amp;c.
These occur about the eighth day, and, after more or less duration, gradually
disappear. After this period, there generally appears an eruption on the
skin, of a whitish yellow or red colour, accompanied by considerable itching,
discharging a watery humour, and finally desquamating, with occasionally
some fever.</p>

<p>If the baths be continued longer, the prostration and lassitude increase,
accompanied by great irritability and moroseness, loss of appetite, furred
tongue, nausea, fætid eructations, repugnance to the bath, wandering pains
in the limbs—in fine, fever is kindled up, with inflammation of the mucous
membrane of the stomach and bowels. This is what the Germans call
“<span class="smcap">das ueberbaden</span>,” or over-bathing—and occurs after eighteen or twenty
baths—sometimes not till after forty or sixty.</p>

<p>Dr. Richter conceives that, in all cases where it is deemed proper to
stimulate the circulation and the lymphatics—to rouse the energy of the
nervous system when paralyzed—to excite strongly the functions of the
skin—to depurate bad humours—to expel a morbid principle from the
constitution or the internal organs—to relax contracted tendons or muscles—to
reduce abnormal or morbid growths—it will be necessary to have
recourse to the <span class="smcap">hot</span> baths of Teplitz, watching their effects, and moderating
their action from time to time, according to circumstances.</p>

<p>The <i>warm</i> baths (95° to 100°) re-animate the human organism—cause
a sense of comfort (bien-être)—gently excite the circulation—equalize the
excitability of the nervous system—and impart elasticity to the muscles.
They do not cause perspiration: but rather absorption of fluids, internal
as well as external—resolve enlargements of glands or other parts—correct
acidity—prove diuretic—and excite the healthy action of the uterine
system. The symptoms of “<span class="smcap">over-bathing</span>,” described under the head
of hot baths, less frequently occur, with the warm bath—are more moderate
in degree, when they do occur—and are longer in making their appearance.
It is needless to observe that these are much safer than the hot
baths.</p>

<p>The tepid baths of Teplitz (84° to 94°) diminish nervous irritability—dispose
to sleep—render the respiration slower—soften and abate the action
of the heart and arteries—diminish the size of external parts—increase
the action of the kidneys and internal glands—promote absorption. With
this temperature of the waters, the symptoms of “over-bathing” seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
appear. It may be remarked, that they have here, as at Wildbad, baths
where the waters rise through the sand at the bottom of the basin. As
the spring is constantly rising and running away, the temperature cannot
be regulated, and those springs are selected for the sand-baths, where
the temperature is about blood-heat. The same advantages are attached
to the sand-baths here, as at Wildbad—namely, that the waters are always
running in and out of the bath, which is kept at the same degree of heat
always. The same advantage attaches to the stone-baths at Pfeffers, and
the latter are, I think, more cleanly—at least to the imagination.</p>

<p>The internal use of the Teplitz waters is considered favourable to the
physiological or remedial action of the baths. They have some aperient
properties—promote mucous and other secretions—but their chief action
is on the absorbents, and therefore they are most used in those cases where
there are tumours to be dispersed, or abnormal growths to be removed.
There can be little danger in drinking such pure waters as those of
Teplitz.</p>

<p>The special or particular maladies for which the waters and baths of this
place have long been renowned, were already stated in the extract from
Dr. Granville. Dr. Richter has dedicated a chapter to the <i>modus operandi</i>
of the Teplitz baths on gout, both local and in its complications with
affections of the digestive organs, lungs, heart, &amp;c.—on chronic rheumatism,
in its various seats, and with its painful consequences, as swellings of
the joints, ankylosis, muscular contractions, loss of power, &amp;c.—<i>paralysis</i>,
numbers of patients affected with which, come annually to Teplitz, to
throw away their crutches, and—“retourner gaiement dans leurs foyers.”
The noise, however, of a brilliant cure too often brings to Teplitz paralytic
sufferers, with organic diseases of the brain or spine, and therefore
beyond the reach of all remedy. Rickets, disease of the hip-joint, and
spinal distortion, are said to be eminently relieved, and often cured by the
Teplitz waters. The same may be said of various cutaneous diseases,
especially in their chronic forms—suppression of the natural or habitual
evacuations—ulcers—disposition to gravel and stone—old and painful
wounds, healed or open—diseases resulting from metallic fumes—swellings
and engorgements of the liver, spleen, and other abdominal organs—hæmorrhoids—nervous
asthma—chronic sickness—colics—hysteria—hypochondriasis—derangements
peculiar to females—sterility—in short, three
fourths of human affections, in their chronic or tedious conditions!</p>

<p>The counter-indications are here much the same as at the other thermal
springs—namely, states of plethora, local or general—and all dispositions
to inflammatory or feverish affections. The cautions and precautions need
not be repeated in this place.</p>

<p>Mud-baths have been established at Teplitz since 1835—one establishment
is at the Stadtbad—the other at the Schlangenbad. The peat-bog
it found to the north of the town, and contains, according to the analysis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
of Messrs. Wolf and Pleische, the sulphates, muriates, carbonates, and
humates of soda—lime—magnesia—iron—and much ulmine and other
organic remains. They are prepared in the same manner as at Franzensbad
and other places, and are much used in cutaneous complaints—rheumatism
and gout of obstinate character—deformities and nodosities, the
sequences of these maladies—neuralgic and paralytic affections—metallic
diseases—tumours and indurations of glandular structures, as of the liver,
spleen, mesentery, ovaries, &amp;c. They are wisely forbidden in organic
diseases of the heart and other vital viscera, in high grades of nervous irritability,
and in all predispositions to hæmorrhages, on account of their
high powers of stimulation. An English lady of rank was using them
here, and spoke in high terms of their salutary effects.</p>

<h4>TOPOGRAPHY.</h4>

<p>The town of Teplitz is not very interesting. The street that leads from
the <span class="smcap">Market-place</span> to the <span class="smcap">Place du Chateaux</span>, is chiefly composed of
hotels—none of them of first-rate character. From the Prince de Clairy’s
palace (which looks like a cotton-factory in Manchester) we turn down an
abrupt little street to the great bathing-places—including the Herrenhaus,
and the gardens behind, where the waters are drunk by a very few persons.
The gardens behind the Prince de Clairy’s residence are umbrageous and
pleasant; but the masses of stagnant, or almost stagnant, green water,
amongst them, are neither agreeable to the eye nor healthy to the constitution.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood of Teplitz is very beautiful and picturesque. A
walk of fifteen minutes up a steep ascent from the Herrenhaus takes us
to the <span class="smcap">Spitalberg</span>, from the summit of which, where there is an imitation
of a ruin, a fine view may be taken of Teplitz and the surrounding
country for twenty miles in every direction. A still finer and more extensive
view is had from the <span class="smcap">Schlossberg</span>, two miles distant from Teplitz,
and mounted without much difficulty. The mountain is crowned with the
old ruin of a strong castle, from which a magnificent panorama is seen.
To the South-East we contemplate Boreslau, and the numerous conical
heads of the Mittlegebirge mountains, as far as Aussig, where the silver
Elbe is seen flowing along.—To the North-East is the long line of the
Erzgeberg (Metalliferous) mountains, the frontiers of Saxony—while directly
North, the battle-field of Culm, with its three brazen monuments,
lies stretched before us, with all its historical associations and recollections
of the brave but bloody deeds which were there enacted, even in our own
days!</p>

<p>The history of the Schlossberg is veiled in obscurity. It was a rebel’s
or perhaps a robber’s citadel, some eight hundred years ago; but has been
a mass of ruins since the time of the Hussites. It was partially rebuilt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
in the fifteenth century, by John de Wresowec, and its praises were chanted
by the poet <span class="smcap">Mitis</span>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent4">——Cujusdam refulgent</div>
<div class="verse">Mænia vixque non attingentia nubes,</div>
<div class="verse">Quæ <span class="smcap">Wresowichia</span> jecit de stirpe Joannes.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The walls which then “all but reached the clouds,” have now, all but
crumbled into dust, like Wresowec and all his ancestors and descendants!
It was from this ruin that the Emperor of Russia, the Emperor of Austria
and King of Prussia surveyed, with no small anxiety—perhaps fear—the
great events that passed underneath them on the field of Culm.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, Teplitz may be considered as the most fashionable
bathing-place in all Germany—scarcely a season passing, without crowned
heads and flocks of nobility coming here to rid themselves of bodily infirmities
or cares of the mind.</p>

<h4><i>Translation of a Note received from Dr. Richter, of Teplitz, (by Mr.
Spitta) dated 18th Sept. 1840.</i></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,—In my little work on the waters of this place, I find
I have entirely omitted to mention the subject of <span class="smcap">paralysis</span>, occasioned by
mechanical injuries, and especially those which sometimes follow difficult
accouchements. On this topic, Dr. Siebold, one of the most eminent
obstetrical practitioners in Germany, has published his opinions, and
strongly recommends the baths of Teplitz, as more efficacious than any
other remedy.</p>

<p>I omitted also, in my “<span class="smcap">Environs of Teplitz</span>,” to allude to the mineral
waters of Püllna, Sedlitz, and Saidschitz, so celebrated all over Europe,
and which are situated at four leagues from Teplitz, on the Carlsbad road.
The village of Püllna lies in a beautiful plain, two or three hundred yards
from the Chaussee, on the right; and the mineral springs themselves are
close to the road. I refer you to Mr. Spitta for further particulars.</p>

<p>P.S.—A rail-road is forming between Dresden and Prague, to run by
Teplitz. This will render the communication between London, Teplitz,
and Carlsbad, extremely easy and quick.</p>

<p>I am, dear Sir,</p>

<p class="center">Your’s truly,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Theodore L. Richter</span>, M.D.</p>

<p><i>Teplitz, 18th Sept. 1840.</i></p>

<h4><i>Extract of a Paper of Mr. Spitta’s on the Waters of Püllna, &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p>Within a morning’s drive from Teplitz, are situated three mineral springs,
little known, yet in many respects extremely interesting—Püllna, Saidschitz,
and Sedlitz. They all yield a water of a similar nature, rich in the
sulphates of magnesia and soda; and which is so peculiarly bitter, as to
have acquired the title of “Bitterwasser.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Having heard so much of this bitterwasser in Germany, and of the powders
of Sedlitz at home, I was anxious to ascertain the true nature of the
springs; and see if they really afforded a mineral water so agreeable and
salutary as we get in England by dissolving our “genuine <i>Sedlitz</i> powders.”
I proposed an excursion, and Dr. Richter, of Teplitz, with his usual urbanity,
kindly accompanied me.</p>

<p>So near as Teplitz is to these springs, it will doubtless appear strange
to others as it did to me, that, no one, not even the people at the post-office,
where we ordered the carriage, could tell us their exact position. So
great a traffic! so much Sedlitz salt prepared! one hardly knew how to
account for such ignorance. Püllna, indeed, they had heard of; for, being
on the road from Carlsbad to Teplitz, it could not well have been overlooked;
Saidschitz was conceived, by possibility, to exist; but, as to poor
Sedlitz, where all our powders come from, its very existence was denied;
nor was it, till we were within a mile, that we learnt its situation from a
few wandering peasants.</p>

<p>I may mention a few of the general characters of these bitterwasser springs
before noticing each separately. Their method of formation is peculiar.
Large circular holes are dug into a stratum of earth, which contains the
saline ingredients; in these the rain-water is allowed to collect: it dissolves
the salts, and yields the bitterwasser. It is really very remarkable,
that a stratum of soil should be found containing so large an amount of
saline ingredient; and not the less singular, that it is of so limited an extent;
thus, at Saidschitz, it has a diameter of about a quarter to half a
mile; and a well dug beyond this area will yield no bittersalz. The soil
is easily recognized by its yellow-white colour, and by the fact that nothing
grows upon it. The plautago indeed, and some species of hieracea (hawk’s
weed) exist there; and I had the curiosity to bring home a specimen of
the former plant, because the man who had been some years in charge of
the wells at Saidschitz, knew the character of the soil, and judged of the
propriety of sinking another well in any given spot, by its presence or
absence.</p>

<p>In a geological point of view, these springs are not without interest.
They are, if I may be allowed so botanical a comparison, a completely
different genus of the great class “mineral spring.” It has been asserted,
that mineral springs in general are formed by solution of the salts in the
neighbouring mountains, by the rain-water which passes through them.
This opinion, for many reasons, has <i>seemed</i> to me erroneous; but these
springs furnish a <i>proof</i> by analogy, of great weight. For here are springs
really formed by such an artificial method; and what happens? The
soil furnishes (which is not the case with the soil in the neighbourhood
of any other springs) the same water by artificial digestion. The late
Dr. Struve succeeded in this manner in forming a very capital Püllna.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Again, these springs formed so artificially are uninfluenced, like others, by
volcanic shocks, and earthquakes. The Hauptquelle, at Teplitz, stopped
for a moment, during the earthquake at Lisbon, and then rushed forth
with redoubled violence. Many other sources also have been similarly
affected. Indeed, from Lyall’s account, it seems to be no uncommon circumstance:
and new ones have even risen into existence, at such awful
crises. On they go, however, the bitter springs, from year to year, totally
regardless. They have no fixed temperature; because, as I presume, they
are not in connexion with the centre of the earth. They have no fixed
level of water, from the same cause. They vary, on the contrary, like
all other common springs at the surface, with the temperature of the atmosphere,
and the quantity of water which percolates the earth to supply
them.</p>

<h4>SAIDSCHITZ.</h4>

<p>The first we visited was Saidschitz, about three hours drive from Teplitz:
and I would advise none but those anxiously desirous of medical observation,
to venture there. The road is shocking; at one part I was
walking, whilst my friend Dr. Richter was reclining in the carriage.
Suddenly a large rut appeared, and I feel convinced, that, had not the
coachman and myself propped up the side of the carriage, which was
falling towards us, it would, with all its professional contents, have been
quietly precipitated.</p>

<p>Arrived at length, and eager to taste the water, of which so much had been
said, I swallowed some of the most nauseous physic it is possible to prescribe.
Instead of the nice saline draught which <i>our</i> Sedlitz powder makes, of
tartrate of soda and potash, rendered even effervescent by the succeeding
additions of carbonated soda and tartaric acid, the bitterwasser of Saidschitz
consists of a strong solution of Epsom and Glauber’s salts; and I need not
say that the term “bitterwasser” is most appropriately applied. There
are twenty-two wells at Saidschitz, all capable of furnishing a large quantity
of water, though few only are in actual use. They are included, as I
previously said, within an area of about a quarter of a mile; and each well
is covered with a small wooden shed, like a hay-cock. When drawn, the
water is quite clear, and without any bubbles of carbonic acid. It has no
smell, but a slightly brown color, depending on the presence of a peculiar
acid, termed by Berzelius the “<i>chrenic</i>” (χρηνη, source). It undergoes no
alteration by standing.</p>

<p>Most of these properties would have been anticipated from an inspection
of the following analysis<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> published by Professor Berzelius.</p>

<p>The water is not allowed to be bottled at Saidschitz, but is sent to Bilin,
a little town about two hours drive from Teplitz, for that purpose.</p>

<p>Saidschitz salt however is prepared there in considerable quantities.
The water is evaporated to a proper degree of concentration, when the
three sulphates of soda, potash, and magnesia, crystallize. They present
crystals of large size. Again dissolved and concentrated, the latter salt
is separated from the two former by its greater solubility; and the new
solution, when crystallized, furnishes the Saidschitz salt—a tolerably pure
sulphate of magnesia. The popular term in Germany for sulphate of
magnesia corresponding to our “Epsom salt” is “bittersalz;” but it is
known also as Saidschitz and Püllna salz; so that, if you enter a chemist’s,
and demand a salt with either of the above titles, he will supply you from
a certain bottle, labelled sal-amarum. If you ask for Sedlitz-salt, he will
smile at your ignorance, and quietly tell you he does not keep it; and for
this, we shall presently see, there is the very best of reasons. The prince
is said to get about 1200 florins of good Austrian money annually by his
salt making.</p>

<h4>SEDLITZ.</h4>

<p>It is but a quarter of an hour’s drive from Saidschitz to Sedlitz; a name
better known, perhaps, in England, than that of any other spa in Germany.
For who has not had a Sedlitz? a <i>genuine</i> Sedlitz? or who has not bought
a box of these powders, with the acid in the blue and the alkali in the
white paper? as though the wondrous spring could produce a salt, acid or
alkaline, at the pleasure of the chemist who dispensed it?</p>

<p>Large manufactories indeed must be there! and how thriving a village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Sedlitz must be!! A few miserable hovels, however, soon undeceive you,
tenanted by the poorest of the poor. There are nine springs, not separate
from the village of the same name, as at Saidschitz, but interspersed
among the houses; and really it requires no small discernment to distinguish
which are dwelling-houses, and which represent the wooden sheds
covering the wells. Spring, No. 2, is the only one in use; and well,
No. 2, the only one supplied with a bucket. The bucket was lowered by
a rope and windlass (just conceive how civilized a bath-place); and brought
up, full of water, for our inspection. I was not caught twice; I did not
venture to taste this Bitterwasser with so much rashness. Its taste, color,
and other physical properties, are exactly similar to those of Saidschitz-water,
except that they are rather less marked, from its containing a smaller
quantity of mineral ingredients. The following analysis by Professor
Steinmann will be interesting.</p>

<p>But where is the salt-manufactory, asked Dr. Richter? The woman was
astonished—she knew not, nor had she ever heard of such a thing, although
she had been in charge of the wells for thirty years. Her aged
mother solved the difficulty. About thirty-three years ago. Prince
Lobkowitz rented Sedlitz of the “ordre des chevaliers de l’etoile rouge,”
and then a salt apparatus was in action. Finding, I presume, that Saidschitz
was a more prolific source of bittersalz, he stopped the process at
Sedlitz; so that absolutely, for the thirty-three long years that we have
been drinking and enjoying our <i>genuine</i> Sedlitz powders, not a single atom
of salt has been prepared.</p>

<p>But it is said, Saidschitz salt has been prepared, it imports little, that
the mere name should have been mis-spelt. I answer—truly; a mere verbal
error is of no moment; but when it is found, that the salt of Saidschitz and
Sedlitz waters is sulphate of magnesia or Epsom salts; and when further it
is observed, that the renowned Sedlitz powders are composed, for the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
part, of Rochelle salt, or the triple tartrate of potash and soda, I confess,
it seems that more than a verbal error is committed.</p>

<p>Like Saidschitz, the waters of Sedlitz are bottled at the establishment
of Prince Lobkowitz, at Bilin. Some is sent into Germany; by far the
greater part goes to Paris; none to England. The bottles are known
by the peculiar manner in which they are stopped; they have metal collars
round the necks, on which metal caps are screwed. It is a singular circumstance,
that, at Teplitz, not a single bottle of Sedlitz water could be
obtained.</p>

<p>Before quitting Prince Lobkowitz and his springs, I may notice another
ingenious application of the Saidschitz water. At Bilin there is a mineral
spring, containing the carbonate of soda, about 23 grains in the pint.
The result is anticipated. It is concentrated considerably by evaporation,
and mixed with the Saidschitz water, also much concentrated; a double
decomposition of the proximate elements of the carbonate of soda in
the one, and the sulphate of magnesia in the other water, ensues: and
a very capital carbonate magnesia is precipitated. The prince is said to
add 500 more florins of good Austrian money to his income by this
preparation.</p>

<h4>PÜLLNA,</h4>

<p class="noindent">The last of the three bitter springs, lying on the road from Carlsbad to
Teplitz, is the property of the village of that name, close by, but is rented
at present, by a private individual. Compared with the two former, it
is quite an elegant spot. There is even a small white hotel opposite the
wells; where, if fortune smiles, and you are in time for Table-d’hôte, you
may get a dinner; but if not, you must fare, as we did, on “butter-brod.”
It contains, moreover, a few baths, supplied with water from the springs;
and one patient, Baron Christophe de Campenhausen, with his medical attendant,
was resident there for the cure. An attempt at a registry of the
visitors is also made. About thirty people, perhaps, may have seen Püllna,
certainly not more than half a dozen English. Of the three bittersprings,
the waters of Püllna have been by far the most drank—it is said that
300,000 of the Püllna dumpty bottles are annually circulated. Bittersalz
is also made here in considerable quantity.</p>

<p>The wells are scattered over a larger area than either at Saidschitz or
Sedlitz; but have the same odd appearance. The physical characters of a
bitterwasser, its yellow tint, oily consistence, and horribly bitter taste, are
here most strongly marked. The last analysis (which I obtained at Püllna)
is by Dr. Ticinus, professor of chemistry at Dresden; and it will be seen
how extremely concentrated a water it is.</p>

<p>I shall add but one word on the medical properties of the bitterwassers.
As a glance at the analyses would anticipate, they are solvent and
diuretic. They are aperient, however, without being at the same time
stimulating; as is the case with the Salzbrunn at Franzensbad, from its
abundance of carbonic acid, and with the Carlsbad water, from its heat.
They, especially the Püllna, which is employed the most frequently, are too
strong to be taken pure. One-third to the half of a dumpty bottle, with an
equal quantity of luke-warm water, will be found an efficient and tolerably
palatable dose. A medicine of this kind, repeated regularly every morning,
is of the greatest advantage to persons habitually costive from sluggishness
of action in the muscular fibre of the intestine, brought on by
sedentary lives, much study at late hours, &amp;c. If this state be accompanied
with hæmorrhoids, the remedy, from its gentle effect, is still more
valuable. In congested states of the liver and spleen, they are efficient;
blood is determined to the intestine, to the relief of the portal vessels. In
actual jaundice, they are even prescribed with advantage.</p>

<p>In mentioning the leading properties of these bittersprings, I do not
think I should be inclined (were he willing) to send a patient there; for I
should expect to hear, either that he had been upset in his journey, or
starved on his arrival. But I have another motive. From the very nature
of the water, containing so little carbonic acid, and so little iron, it can be
imitated with great success. I saw Struve’s process at Dresden; and I
have taken that made at the Brighton spa, with all the effect of the original
and genuine Püllna. It seemed to me a remedy worthy of more patronage
than it had hitherto received.</p>

<p>Finally, I would not wish, from what I have said, to depreciate the
character of our very old and tried friend, the “Sedlitz.” On the contrary—I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
hold him in much veneration. One word only I would add to
his title—I would call him the “<span class="smcap">Genuine (London) Sedlitz Powder</span>.”</p>

<p>P.S.—I may as well state here, for the information of travellers, and
especially of invalids, the ready means of communication that now exist,
independent of the rail-road abovementioned.</p>

<p>The whole run may be done in six days; the traveller sleeping every
night in his bed, and undergoing no fatigue whatever in the day. The
opposite course will require an additional day, on account of the stream of
the Elbe, but may be performed with great ease by all, to whom economy
of time, money, and bodily exertion is of any moment. It is only an easy
day’s journey from Teplitz to Carlsbad, and 24 miles from thence to Marienbad.
The route through Saxon Switzerland alone, will well repay the
journey, which is almost all by water, and the far greater part by river
steaming, where there is no chance of sea-sickness. In fine, the line of
the Elbe offers, as it were, an invalid carriage, by which the most frail
valetudinarian, or the most crippled victim of gout or rheumatism, may
repair to the great fountains of health in Bohemia, with almost as much
ease as if reposing in an arm-chair. J. J.</p>

<h4>CULM.</h4>

<p>On leaving Teplitz, we pass through a highly picturesque country, full
of mountain scenery, but not of that Alpine grandeur which excludes fertility,
cultivation, and beauty, till we come to the Thermopylæ of Bohemia—the
battle-field of Culm—whose history, though “Ære perennius,” is
yet commemorated by three monuments—the Russian and Prussian dedicated
to the memory of those heroes who fell in the combat—the Austrian,
to the general who turned the fortune of the day—and changed a doubtful
and sanguinary battle into a splendid and decided victory.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
monuments are of very different stature and dimensions. The first we
come to is the Russian, a Gothic pyramid of cast iron, of great height,
bearing on its summit the figure of Fame. The portrait of the hero
<span class="smcap">Osterman</span>, who, with 8000 Russians, checked Vandamme and 40,000
Frenchmen, is sculptured on one side. This monument is like Russia itself,
infinitely more colossal than either of the others. The Prussian, like its
kingdom, is the smallest of all—while the Austrian, is next in dimensions
to the Russian, and dedicated, as was observed, to the hero who conquered,
and not to those who fell in the battle. After all, this was perhaps the
wisest plan. The living hero would feel pride and pleasure in contemplating
the monuments; but, alas!</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">No! the blood of the brave has, no doubt, fertilized the soil of this beautiful
valley, while the bodies of heroes, who drew their natal breath on the
banks of the Gneiper and the Vistula—the Elbe and the Danube—the
Rhine and the Rhone—the Seine and the Tiber, have served to fatten the
birds and beasts of prey, as well as the mould of mother-earth—migrating
into myriads of new existences, and completing the mysterious circle of
the <span class="smcap">Samian Sage</span>!</p>

<p>When we glance at this infinitessimal speck of human consciousness

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent10">——were their subjects wise,</div>
<div class="verse">Kings <i>could</i> not play at.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is rather singular that, in our days, at least, though monarchs occasionally
lose their crowns in these games of <i>hazard</i>, they rarely part with
their heads at the same time.</p>

<p>Three Emperors and a King played one of those fearful games of <i>hazard</i>
in the valley of Culm. From the summit of the Schlossberg the royal
Eagles of Austria, Russia, and Prussia beheld, with astonishment, if not
dismay, the sudden and unexpected descent through a gorge in the Erzebirge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
mountains, the fierce, the rapacious, and the ferocious <span class="smcap">Vandamme</span>,
at the head of forty thousand Frenchmen, flushed with the victory of
Dresden (27th August, 1813) and pouncing on the scattered troops of the
allies in the valley, quite unprepared for such an unexpected onslaught!
The “<span class="smcap">Cock of the North</span>,” and <span class="smcap">he</span> of the Danube, “immediately retired.”
Not so the regal bird, with two heads, from the Elbe and the Oder.
He clapped his sable wings, as he snuffed the sulphurous fumes from the
roaring cannon—directed several movements of the allies below—and presented
a wall of steel, to a cloud of cossacks, flying before the enemy—thus
compelling them to face their foes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <span class="smcap">Osterman</span> and his eight thousand Russians slowly and
doggedly retreated (fighting) before Vandamme and his forty thousand
French, till within two miles of Teplitz, when the Gallic general considered
the crowned heads as inevitably within his grasp! Here the Muscovites
stopped short—wheeled round—and crossed the narrow valley, like an
avenue of knotted oaks that might be borne down or torn up by the furious
storm or lightning’s flash, but never would bend. It was in vain that
the “ferocious” Vandamme brought up line after line of his men against
the northern phalanx. They were repulsed, one after the other, as the
basaltic columns of Staffa repel the onsets of the Atlantic surge! As individuals
fell in the Russian ranks, the lines instantly closed again, as if
by a vital and instinctive movement of the whole body! When the last
column of Vandamme had failed to break the Russian phalanx, the furious
and disconcerted Frank retreated in his turn, and encamped on the field of
Culm for the night. This gave time for the panic-stricken and disordered
allies to collect, combine, and arrange for the grand struggle of the coming
day. The dawn (30th August) had not yet unveiled the peaks of the
surrounding mountains, when all were ready and panting for the sanguinary
conflict.</p>

<p>The allies under Schwartzenburg may now have outnumbered the French
under Vandamme, but their <i>morale</i> was depressed by the recent disasters
at Dresden, and their <i>physique</i> exhausted by their almost superhuman exertions
in dragging their cannon, baggage, and ammunition over the rugged
summits of the Bohemian mountains. On the other hand, the French
were elated beyond measure by the recent and successive victories of Lutzen,
Botzen, and Dresden—but still more by the star of Napoleon, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
was now rising, like a Phœnix from the ashes of Moscow, and approaching
its second zenith on the banks of the Elbe. Daylight, however, had
scarcely enabled the armies to distinguish friend from foe, when they rushed
simultaneously into mortal conflict. Vandamme lay between a great
crescent of the allies on the West, and the towery ridge of Erzeberg in his
rear, and from which he had descended the preceding morning. The
“fiery Frank” fought like a tiger encompassed and goaded by hunters—while
the “furious <span class="smcap">hun</span>” successfully repelled his repeated efforts to break
the line of the allies, and even drove him nearer and nearer to the mountain
behind. The pass of the Erzeberg, through which Vandamme descended
into the valley, now presented the only opening by which he could
effect his egress out of it. The order for retreat was given; but what was
the surprize of the French on entering the defile from below, when they
beheld a body of Prussians enter it from above! The surprize and consternation,
however, were mutual. Kleist, who, with five or six thousand
Prussians, had been wandering among the mountains since the disaster of
Dresden, and who was now hurrying to Teplitz to join the allies, was
thunderstruck to see the French scrambling up the defile to meet him,
and considered his retreat as cut off. Vandamme looked upon himself as
in precisely the same predicament. Kleist knew that the French columns
were pressing onward in his rear—Vandamme knew full well that the Austro-Prusso-Russian
army was close at his heels. The object of each corps
in the defile was therefore to cut through its opponent, and escape in the
direction of its friends. Under these impressions, they rushed into tumultuous
combat, and were soon mingled in inextricable confusion. The
officers of one corps were sometimes in the midst of the soldiery of the
other, and <i>vice versa</i>—all fighting pell-mell like two hostile mobs, without
order or command—individually rather than collectively—often wresting
the arms from their opponents, and fighting with the weapons of their
enemies! So desperate a struggle on such a precipitous pass, was never,
perhaps, witnessed since the days of Leonidas in the Straits of Thermopylæ!
The Prussians had the vantage ground, inasmuch as their own
weight gave them an increased momentum in rushing down the declivity—the
French had greatly the advantage in numbers, both in horse and
foot; but Kleist prevailed, and Vandamme and his army were hurled back
into the valley below, when the allies closed round them and the Gallic
Eagles surrendered!</p>

<p>On the field of Culm the sable wing of destiny threw a shade over the
star of Napoleon, which never afterwards regained its splendour, or stayed
its downward course, till it sunk in the far Atlantic. On the plains of
Marne and Waterloo, indeed,<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> that star emitted some vivid corruscations;
but they only tended to exhaust its fire and accelerate its fall!</p>

<h4>TETCHEN.</h4>

<p>Full of ruminations on the vicissitudes of human life—the vanity of
man’s hopes—and the nothingness of his works—we drove through a
highly picturesque valley, at the foot of the last range of the Bohemian
mountains, till we suddenly debouched on the silvery Elbe, at the bustling
and boating little town of Tetchen. The first object which arrested our
attention was a huge pile of white buildings standing on a bold and jutting
promontory some seven or eight hundred feet above the right bank of the
river, with thrice as many windows in its walls as there were eyes in the
head of Argus. Various were our conjectures as to whether the edifice
before us was an immense barrack, an overgrown convent, where half the
daughters of Bohemia might prepare for another world, or a great factory?
Even the oracular authority of the “<span class="smcap">red-book</span>” could not persuade us
that it was a palace. The river at this place is always crowded with boats
of all shapes and sizes laden with merchandize—chiefly hewn stone from
the rocky banks, and timber from the pine-clad mountains. We had some
difficulty in getting the carriage along between a precipice on the left, and
the stream on our right, but at length got safely housed in the <span class="smcap">Josephsbad</span>
Hotel—“in one of the most romantic situations which the banks of the river
Elbe afford.”—<i>Murray.</i> Here we learnt that the great pile of building was
actually the palace or castle of Count Thun, and crossing the ferry we
scrambled up through a straggling town to the rear of the castle, and then
climbed up a road of rock that led to the chateau, and which was steep
enough for goats, though the tracks of wheels, worn in the smooth and
precipitous stone, shewed that less agile animals than the ibex had dragged
their weary way to the summit. The view from the castle is remarkably
picturesque, though rather hemmed in by hills, rocks, and mountains—the
winding Elbe soon disappearing in the dark ravines of <span class="smcap">Saxon Switzerland</span>.
Count Thun’s library is, I believe, the great lion of the castle;
but as I never could derive much amusement or information from a survey
of the backs of books, we returned to our eagle’s nest, the Josephsbad,
and slept sound over the murmuring Elbe. There is a chalybeate spring
here of some local reputation, and certainly an invalid could not easily
select a more romantic spot for the restoration of health than Tetchen.</p>

<p>We embarked in a gondola early in the morning, and immediately entered
“<span class="smcap">Saxon Switzerland</span>,” a tract of country extending from Tetchen to
the neighbourhood of Dresden, and perfectly unique in character, bearing
little or no resemblance to Switzerland, or to any other country in the
world through which I have passed. It has none of the snowy solitudes,
the sparkling glaciers, or the majestic altitude of the Alps; but it has a
geographical and geological physiognomy, of which there is “nil simile
aut secundum” on this globe. The river runs through a gorge, which is,
in fact, a gigantic excavation—a huge crevasse—a profound chasm, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
rocky bed of an antediluvian ocean, disclosing glimpses of “the world
before the flood,” and letting out some of the “secrets of the prison-house.”
Whether this ocean-bed was raised from its dark abyss by the
agency of subterranean fire, or was left uncovered by the subsidence of the
superincumbent sea, may admit of question; but no doubt can be entertained
as to the formation of those rocky walls that now rise a thousand
feet high on each side of the stream. They are piled, layer over layer, in
strata of different thickness and different density—but all as horizontal as
the ocean under which they once lay. They were all, therefore, depositions
from the sea, and considering that most of these strata are hard
enough to form millstones, imagination is lost in the vain attempt to estimate
the countless ages that must have rolled away during the deposition
and consolidation of even a single stratum—how many millions of years,
then, must it have required to form layer over layer, of this immense crust,
at the bottom of the ocean, leaving aside the unknown intervals that must
have elapsed between the various deposits!! Again, the elevation of the
earth, or the subsidence of the waters, so as to produce the complete denudation
of this rocky district, could not but occupy ages of ages. In
whatever way this long chain of stratifications took place, it is quite evident
that it was long subjected to powerful currents. The layers are all
grooved and furrowed <i>horizontally</i>, in the line of the river, and not <i>perpendicularly</i>,
as by rains descending along their sides. It is true they are often
split perpendicularly and irregularly; but this is quite the work of time
and decay—not at all like the horizontal smoothing, the consequence of
long-continued watery friction. Some travellers have supposed that the
river Elbe has hewn its way through these rocks and formed the huge
ravine on the principle—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Gutta cavat lapidem non vi sed sæpe cadendo.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But as the very summits of the rock (800 feet high) shew the same proofs
of horizontal “wear and tear” as the lowest strata, what must have been
the state of the surrounding country, when the Elbe was 800 feet above its
present level? It was covered with water, and the grooves in the rocks
were the effects of currents, not rivers—in other words, they are <i>diluvial</i>
and not <i>fluvial</i> phenomena. But the banks of this stream are not the only
places here which exhibit proofs and records of a deluge. The neighbouring
country, especially on the right bank, and where no rivers exist, is
studded with “fragments of an earlier world,” all bearing the same marks
of watery attrition, from their highest to their lowest strata. Although
many of these “splinter’d pinnacles,” are columnar in shape, they are
tabular in construction—all shewing horizontal strata (where they have
not tumbled down), and all evincing a greater wear and tear of the interstitial
materials between the layers, than of the layers themselves—another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
proof of the lateral and not perpendicular action of the waters by which
they were worn smooth.</p>

<p>We descended slowly in our gondola, the day being splendidly clear,
and the wind blowing fresh against us, which retarded our progress, but
favoured our examination of the infinitely varied scenery in this romantic
gorge. At Neidergrund, on the left bank, we were stopped by the last
Austrian Douane, for examination of passports; and then continued our
descent. At this place, however, there is a huge fragment of rock which
must have rolled from the adjacent cliff, at some remote period, but which
is now perfectly smooth in every part of its surface, from the friction of
the floods. In this stone, there is also a polished excavation, with a narrow
door, in which, it is said, a pious hermit once resided. Hence its name—“<span class="smcap">Monchenstein</span>.”
It is worth examining while the tardy Douanier is
poring over your passport, and filling unmeaning columns in his musty
journals.</p>

<p>A league farther on, where the right bank rises like a wall to a stupendous
height, and demonstrating the stratifications with peculiar distinctness,
we come to a huge pile of buildings, overhung by massive crags of rocks,
and forming a douane, police-station, and hotel. Here we encounter the
Saxon Custom-house, where our trunks were opened and examined—an
operation which was never once performed by Prussian, Bavarian, or Austrian,
during our whole journey. And here I must do the Austrians, who
are represented as so very <i>austere</i> in their police and douanes, the justice to
say that, in no part of their dominions did we ever experience the slightest
interruption or inconvenience in respect to passports; nor did they ever
ask us for the key of a trunk on entering, travelling through, or quitting
their territories.</p>

<p>From this place (Herrnskretchen), excursions are often made, by people
who have plenty of time on their hands, to the summit of the “<span class="smcap">Winterberg</span>,”
where a very extensive prospect of Saxon Switzerland and the
Bohemian ranges is obtained. The mountain prospect is hardly worth
the toil of the mountain journey. Better prospects are obtained from two
points to be presently noticed, where the view, though not quite so wide,
is infinitely more distinct and striking, and where the points themselves
possess the highest degree of interest, which the summit of the Winterberg
does not. The <span class="smcap">Preberchthor</span>, however, a league and a half from
Herrnskretchen, is worth seeing. It is a gigantic natural arch of rock,
exhibiting well the stratified formation, and looking like the portal of some
enchanted castle, being 60 ells (French) in height, the same in breadth, and
30 in depth. The arch itself is 1400 feet and more above the level of the
sea. The summit, or key-stone of the arch forms a kind of narrow
slanting platform, 30 or 40 feet in length, from which a romantic prospect
opens on the view.</p>

<p>The Kuhstall (or cow-house) is another natural arch, where the strata<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
of rock appear to be somewhat bent as they stride over the aperture below.
Various other “disjecta membra” of an antediluvian world are scattered
about between the Winterberg and Schandau.</p>

<p>We remained but a short time at Schandau; and, after dinner, hired a
gondola, where a female rowed manfully against the breeze, assisted by
her husband and brother, and in a couple of hours we reached</p>

<h4>KŒNIGSTEIN.</h4>

<p>This is one of the lions of Saxon Switzerland—a kind of jung-frau
fortress that has never yielded to shot, shell, or escalade. It is situated on
the left bank of the river, near the town of Kœnigstein, from whence we
ascended by a long and steep road that required full an hour before we
arrived at the gate of this impregnable fortress. The Saxon war minister
being governor of Kœnigstein, our passports procured us admission, with
an orderly to shew us round. One of the most prominent features of this
country is, the projection from its surface of numerous truncated cones of
the same kind of stratified rock which compose the banks of the Elbe.
They rise almost perpendicularly from plain or hill, to various heights of
one hundred to seven or eight hundred feet, with a flat surface on the top,
like a sugar-loaf with its upper third cut off. Kœnigstein is one of the
largest of these natural forts, and the strongest. It springs from an elevated
ground, and is at least fifteen hundred feet above the level of the
Elbe that flows at its base. The walls are not columnar, but masses of
horizontal strata piled upon one another, precisely like those composing the
banks of the river, the highest as well as lowest layers presenting the same
horizontal “wear and tear,” produced by the action of long-continued
currents of water. The plateau on the summit of this antediluvian citadel
occupies a space of two or three acres, which, considering the locality,
supports a good deal of vegetation, trees, and fruit. Excavations in the
rock serve as bomb-proofs for provisions, ammunition, and military barracks,
if assailed. The plateau is encircled by a coronet of cannon and mortars,
and in the spaces between the embrasures, immense heaps of stones are
piled up, to be hurled on the heads of those who ventured to approach the
rocky ramparts of this aerial fortress. Down through the centre of the
rock a well is bored to the depth of 1800 feet, and from this source an
abundant supply of excellent water is drawn up by a wheel, like a tread-mill,
worked, or rather walked, by half a dozen soldiers. In the centre of
the plateau there is a circus, where the governor with one of his aide-de-camps
was galloping round, for air and exercise.</p>

<p>We made the entire circuit of the ramparts, and from these the most
extensive views are taken in every direction, embracing scenery so strange,
romantic, and beautiful, that no language can do it justice—nor pencil
neither! At its eastern base flows the winding Elbe, and directly opposite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
on the other side of the stream, rises <span class="smcap">Lilienstein</span>, about three miles distant
from Kœnigstein, and of a precisely similar shape and composition.
A German prince, who was also a Polish king, had the courage and dexterity
to scale the <i>Lilienstein</i>, and was so proud of the exploit, that he
commemorated it by an inscription near the place of ascent. Napoleon,
in one of his German forays, succeeded, with incredible labour and difficulty,
to elevate some guns to the summit of this gigantic rock, in order
to batter Kœnigstein, but his labour was lost, for the shot fell short of
the sister fortress. But Kœnigstein might have laughed at Bonaparte even
if his cannon could have swept the houses from the plateau of the Saxon
strong-hold. It would have remained as impregnable as ever. The
view from this spot takes in the whole or nearly the whole of Saxon
Switzerland, and extends to thirty or forty miles in every direction—from
the Winterberg to <span class="smcap">Dresden</span>, the towers of which are plainly visible. All
the peculiar rocks in the shape of truncated cones, as well as those masses
of pillars and cliffs about the Bastei, are distinctly seen from Kœnigstein.
Mr. Russell has the following passage in his work on Germany.</p>

<p>“The striking feature is, that in the bosom of this amphitheatre, a plain
of the most varied beauty, huge columnar hills start up at once from the
ground, at great distances from each other, overlooking in lonely and
solemn grandeur, each its own portion of the domain. <i>They are monuments
which the Elbe has left standing to commemorate his triumph over
their less hardy kindred.</i> The most remarkable among them are the Lilienstein
and Kœnigstein, which tower, nearly in the centre of the plain, to a
height of above 1200 feet above the Elbe.”</p>

<p>I have marked a sentence, in italics, because it conveys an erroneous
idea. It may be poetical; but it is not philosophical. If the Elbe was
the Deluge, or the Deluge was the Elbe, all well. But I think Mr. Russell
would hardly contend for this identity. The fact is, that the <span class="smcap">Deluge</span> wore
away the softer parts from around Kœnigstein, Lilienstein, and all the
other Steins, ten thousand, or, more likely, ten million of years before the
Elbe was born! The diminutive stream of the river merely conducted its
rills from the mountains through the bottom of the chasm hollowed out by
the mighty currents of an antediluvian ocean.</p>

<p>It required two hours to visit the cloud-capt towers and frowning battlements
of this impregnable citadel, whose walls were not built by human
hands, but constructed beneath the waters of some mighty deep. The
magnificent and singular scenery which everywhere bursts on the astonished
eye from the cannon-crown’d crest of Kœnigstein, can never be erased
from the memory.</p>

<p>We descended from the fortress to the town, tired, hunger’d, but highly
gratified by the excursion. Fickle Fortune is not always profuse of her
gifts. The feast of the eye this day was purchased by a fast of the
stomach. Notwithstanding the care we had taken to order the “<span class="smcap">huhn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
gebraten</span>,” the “<span class="smcap">schinken</span>,” the “<span class="smcap">kartoflen</span>,” and other little matters
for dinner, all of which were civilly promised, with a hearty “ja wohl
mynheer,” into the bargain; yet, to our mortification, up came the infernal
or at least the eternal dish—mutton-chops, composed of old meat
pounded into a paste, squeezed into a mould, fried with butter, covered
with flour, and pierced with the ribs of some “<i>schaf</i>” that might have
been slaughtered the preceding year! Remonstrance was vain, and complaint
was unavailing. Dish after dish was returned untouched—and dish
after dish of the <i>same materials</i>, came back again, in other forms! With
a sorrowful heart and an empty stomach, I called to mind the first line of
Ovid’s Metamorphoses—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“In <i>nova</i>, fert animus, <i>mutatas</i> dicere <i>formas</i>,</div>
<div class="verse"><i>Corpora</i>.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As a forlorn hope, we requested some cheese; when, lo, after a quarter of
an hour’s expectation, in came a wedge exhaling such a complication of all
horrible and unutterable odours, that we were glad to launch it out of the
window among the pigs—and even they scampered off in all directions at
the sight, sound, and smell of this unexpected and apparently unwelcome
visitor! Good comes out of evil. This last consummation of our miseries
fortunately obliterated our appetites as effectually as a fit of sea-sickness
in a gale of wind. The beds were as bad as the board, and the smell of
the cheese seemed to have called forth myriads of the most minute, agile,
and animated beings, who appeared to <i>leap</i> and skip with joy, over our
beds and round our dormitory—but whether in search of the savoury
“kase,” or bent on more sanguinary depredations, I will not pretend to
decide. This I know, that the frolicksome gambols of these black and saltant
imps conduced but very little to sleep, notwithstanding the lightness
of our supper. Mr. Murray says that the <span class="smcap">Inn</span> at Kœnigstein is “tolerable.”
It may be so, but the <span class="smcap">inmates</span> are intolerable! I do not think
that Horace spent a worse night in the Pontine fens, when he was assailed,
on one side by the “mali culices,” and on the other, by the “ranæ palustres.”
We had not the “<i>mali culices</i>,” it is true—but we had far worse customers,
the <i>mali pulices!!</i> In fine, it was the “frogs and flies” of Treponti in
Italy, <i>versus</i> the “fleas and cheese” of Kœnigstein in Germany. I would
pit the <i>latter</i> against the <i>former</i> any Summer’s night of the year!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 id="THE_BASTEI">THE BASTEI.</h3>

<p>We left Kœnigstein early on a beautiful morning in our gondola, and in
two hours we were housed in New Raden, at the foot of the <span class="smcap">Bastei</span>.
Having procured a guide, we commenced a laborious and steep zig-zag
ascent towards the summit of the arch-lion of Saxon Switzerland. It
required an hour or nearly so, to accomplish this task—each tourniquet of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the ascent opening out more and more extended and splendid prospects.
At length we got into the “regio petrea,” or stony region—sometimes
winding round the bases of huge cliffs—sometimes squeezing through
narrow fissures of the rock—and at others, crossing profound chasms over
slender wooden bridges, or rather foot-paths. When almost despairing of
gaining the summit before our strength was exhausted, we suddenly found
ourselves on a small but level platform, on the highest pinnacle of the
Bastei, and commanding a complete view, not only of the immense mass
of splintered rocks around us, but of the whole country in every direction.
In all my peregrinations round this globe, I never met with any locality
or prospect similar to the one which burst on my astonished sight at this
place!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We stood on the verge of a tremendous precipice, eight hundred feet in
height, and overhanging the Elbe below. Though its brow is fringed with
an iron ballustrade, I observed that very few ventured to look over the
frightful bourne,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Lest the brain turn and the deficient sight</div>
<div class="verse">Topple down headlong.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the opposite direction, rises one of the most singular scenes that ever
opened on the human eye. The billows of an angry ocean suddenly converted
into stone, while agitated by a furious hurricane, might convey some,
but a very imperfect, idea of this astonishing locality. The fractured rocks,
though all presenting the stratifications so often mentioned, and most of
them still horizontal, assume almost every shape and form that imagination
bodies forth in the autumnal clouds that range themselves along the
western horizon, as the cortege of a setting sun, on a beautiful evening.
Pyramids, cliffs, spires, columns, ruins, cupolas, turrets, battlements,
castles, colossal statues and fantastic figures—of everything, in short,
which a fertile fancy can conjure up in the animate or inanimate world.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>After the first emotions of surprize and astonishment have subsided,
we begin to ask ourselves what convulsion of Nature could have
produced this scene of devastation, destruction, and dislocation? Was
it an earthquake?—a volcano?—or a <span class="smcap">deluge</span>? Coupling this last idea
with the acknowledged fact that all these fractured rocks were once a series
of level and solid strata at the bottom of the ocean, the remarkable expression
in Holy Writ rushed on the mind—“And the fountains of the
great deep were broken up.” Whether this indescribable scene of disruption
and dilapidation was produced by any one of those three causes,
or by all in succession, must for ever remain a secret sealed from human
ken,—but it is abundantly evident, from the vast masses of debris along
the banks of the river, that the winds and rains are constantly disintegrating
the softer materials of this “<span class="smcap">Mer de Pierres</span>,” and carrying them
down towards the stream of the Elbe, which acts its part in conveying
them to the bed of the great Northern Ocean, there to form new deposits,
preparatory to some other revolution in our planet, which may once more
raise the bed of the sea into terra firma—and overwhelm our mountains
and plains in unfathomable depths of the vast watery element!</p>

<p>Various paths are formed among the intricacies of the rocks here, and
seats formed for contemplating</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Craggs, knolls, and mounds confusedly hurl’d,</div>
<div class="verse">The fragments of an earlier world.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And few minds can dwell on such a scene without profound reflections on
that Almighty <span class="smcap">Power</span> whose operations are displayed here on such a stupendous
scale.</p>

<p>The external or distant views from the Bastei are still more striking than
those from the fortress of Kœnigstein—more varied in their character, and
having Kœnigstein itself, and also Lilienstein, as most prominent features in
the landscape. The rocky mounds in the same shape as the Lilienstein,
which stand up in every direction, are all seats of legendary tales, nearly
as numerous as those of the Rhine.</p>

<p>We were not a little surprized to find in this eyrie a very comfortable
hotel—the romantic situation of which has no equal in Europe, or in the
world. But we were still more astonished to find horses and carriages in
the court-yard of the inn! We were, at first, inclined to disbelieve the
evidence of our own senses: but soon discovered that the northern approach
to the Bastei admits of a good carriage road, so that invalids or
weakly tourists may ascend to the very edge of the plateau on the summit
of the highest rock, without the slightest fatigue. Near the hotel, there
is seen a gigantic excavation in the rock, five times the size of the Coliseum
in Rome, and very much in the form of a huge natural amphitheatre, surrounded
by a towering rocky wall, of immense height, which wall is
crowned by a great variety of grotesque and colossal figures, bearing more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
or less resemblance to animals and artificial constructions. Here is a very
loud and distinct echo, which adds to the interest of a scene quite unique
on the face of this globe.</p>

<p>We descended by the same path by which we ascended, enjoying the
prospects from various points, and bidding adieu to the most interesting
spot we had ever visited.</p>

<h4>ELBE to DRESDEN.</h4>

<p>Our little gondola floated down the silver Elbe towards Dresden on a
beautiful day, the right bank of the river still preserving its superiority of
scenery over the left. Indeed I think the former bank little, if at all, inferior
to even the best parts of the Rhine—besides the advantage of innumerable
white villas, vineyards, gardens, and orchards, scattered from the
summit of the hills down to the water’s edge.</p>

<h4>PILLNITZ.</h4>

<p>Passing the fortified town of <span class="smcap">Pirna</span> a on the left, we arrived at the summer
residence of the royal family at <span class="smcap">Pillnitz</span>; but too late to avail ourselves
of the permission given to foreigners to see, from a contiguous
gallery, the regal banquet at dinner-hour. The lions had not only fed,
but fled—perhaps to realize our nursery estimate of the felicity attendant
on crowns and sceptres—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The <span class="smcap">King</span> was in his cabinet, counting out his money:</div>
<div class="verse">The <span class="smcap">Queen</span> was in the drawing-room, eating bread and honey.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I certainly feared that the faithful adhesion of Saxony to the fortunes
of Napoleon, though it saved the “galleries” and “green vaults” of Dresden,
had not tended to an overflow of the royal treasury—and I was quite
sure that the battle of Leipsic and the Congress of Vienna had by no
means enlarged the territories of the Saxon Monarch. As to the Queen,
Boney’s inordinate love of <i>bees</i> must have greatly thinned the ranks of
her majesty’s hives on the sunny banks of the Elbe, and diminished the
supply of honey for the use of herself and maids of honour.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Be that as
it may, I sincerely hope that no <i>Saxon</i> queen will ever be reduced from
bread and honey to bread and <i>cheese</i>—for in that event, her majesty’s case
would be hopeless.</p>

<p>We greatly regretted that we had not a glimpse at that magnificent
lioness of Pillnitz, the Princess Amelia, sister to the monarch, and <span class="smcap">Playwriter</span>
to Germany in general. How she, as a Saxon princess, contrived
to depict on the stage, “the domestic manners of the Germans,” as Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Jameson very artfully terms her dramas, is beyond my comprehension, unless
she imitated the Eastern Princes of former days, who went <i>incog.</i> among
their subjects. Be this as it may, I confess I do not see any delineation
of character in these plays that might not be picked up in the library,
theatre, and drawing-room, by any clever girl of Princess Amelia’s calibre
and talents. There is a clearer insight into domestic manners in one of
Horace’s Odes or Satires (vide Sat. VIII.,) than in the whole of the Princess’s
plays put together.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 id="DRESDEN">DRESDEN.</h3>

<p>We approached this city on a beautiful evening—its numerous spires
and domes, its raised terraces, shaded promenades, broad river, and handsome
bridge, making a favourable impression on the stranger’s mind. The
bridge, though said to be the finest in Germany, would make a sorry figure
alongside of our Waterloo—and it bears on its centre arch a memorial that
is not likely ever to appear on any bridge that crosses the Thames—the
marks of a blow-up by a French General. The memorial, however, is not
very complimentary to the Gallic soldiers, who performed the exploit to
prevent the allies from running—<i>after them</i>! I wish the bridge regulation
over the Elbe was enforced on all bridges, and even streets—viz. that of
compelling passengers to take the right-hand side, by which they avoid
jostlings or collisions. The new town, on the right bank, is the unfashionable
one—the old one, the reverse—though the streets of the latter
are narrow, the houses high, and very dull as well as unadorned.</p>

<p>You have scarcely descended from the bridge on the left bank, when you
find yourself entangled between a palace, a church, a theatre, and a minister’s
huge hotel, or rather bureau. Here I observed what I had hitherto
scouted—an “iter ad astra”—a <span class="smcap">royal road to heaven</span>. From the windows
of the palace a royal arch strides across the street, and enters the
Catholic church, high up, near the regal box or pew over the altar!—On
the opposite side rises the theatre. Thus <span class="smcap">Religion</span> sits calmly, but proudly,
between Comedy and Carousel; and the same musical corps which “swell
the notes of praise” in the solemn anthem of morning mass, fill the air
with the dulcet notes of Terpsichore, in the evening Opera. Such easy
transitions would excite some remark in holy England—though there is
nothing, after all, in these double duties of the vocal train—“vox et
pretærea nihil.” But the sight of an English king going every Sunday to
mass would astonish his Protestant subjects. Not so in Dresden. The
Saxons are just as much Protestants as the British are; yet they take no
umbrage at their monarch preferring the Romish to the reformed ritual!!
Would that such peaceable and charitable sentiments were universal in the
world!</p>

<p>The palace itself is the most strange, straggling, and sombre mass or rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
chaos of state prisons that ever monarch inhabited—unless it is <span class="smcap">he</span> of the
Tartarian regions. It runs up the side of one street—down that of another—cuts
a third in two—swallows up a fourth in toto—and then scatters
itself into squares, courts, platzes, galleries, museums, &amp;c. from which a
stranger would find no small difficulty in extricating himself, except by the
aid of Ariadne’s clue, or a rope-yarn longer than any that was ever spun
by a Greenwich pensioner. No wonder that their majesties take their
annual departure from this gloomy abode most punctually on the first day
of May, to enjoy the pure air and romantic prospects of Pillnitz and the
Bastei.</p>

<p>The picture-galleries here have procured for Dresden the title of “the
<span class="smcap">Florence</span> of <span class="smcap">Germany</span>.” I think the “<span class="smcap">Green Vaults</span>,” and “<span class="smcap">Porcelain
Manufactories</span>,” entitle it to the additional appellations of
“Royal Toy-shop of Saxony,” and “China-Warehouse of Europe.”</p>

<p>As good Protestants we first went to the cathedral—but as service was
over we climbed to the summit of the dome, and there we had a most complete
panoramic view of Dresden and the surrounding country, renewing
our acquaintance with our old friends Kœnigstein and Lilienstein, which
stand proudly forth as gigantic guardians of an enchanted land. The dome
of the cathedral is the first spot which a stranger should visit, as it is the
only place which spreads everything before him, as on a map, and all in
their just proportions and distances. The city of Dresden is by no means
extensive, even when including the old and new town; but the surrounding
and distant country presents scenery of great variety and beauty. The
southern views take in Saxon Switzerland—the northern, the fertile plains
and vales that stretch away towards Leipzig and Berlin. It is from this
elevated position that the great field of battle between Napoleon and the
allies (26th and 27th of August 1814) now smiles in peace and cultivation,
instead of being bristled with cannon, and strewed with human sacrifices
at the altar of Mars. The fortifications are now levelled to the ground,
or converted into beautiful shaded walks, gardens, and groves, that lead
out to meet a laughing landscape in every direction. One, and only one,
melancholy object arrests the wandering eye of the delighted observer—the
monument of <span class="smcap">Moreau</span>, on the spot where he fell by the side of the Emperor
Alexander. A plain free-stone block commemorates at once, the
death of the “<span class="smcap">hero Moreau</span>,” and the last victory of Napoleon! From
that moment, the star of this “child of destiny” began to fade in lustre,
and descend from its meridian. The battle of Culm and the disastrous
defeat at Leipzig completed the liberation of Germany; whilst the struggles
in France and Belgium afterwards, were only the pangs of a dying
giant!</p>

<p>It appeared that <span class="smcap">Fortune</span> had, in Napoleon’s case, determined to wipe
the stain of fickleness from her character; but that she became exhausted
by, or, almost ashamed of, pouring incessant favours on a man, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
talents were as brilliant as his ambition was boundless; and whose philanthropy
was so weak that the blood of the whole human race would
scarcely have satiated his thirst of power, while the faintest hope of attaining
or retaining it remained!—a man without moderation in prosperity,
magnanimity in adversity, fidelity in matrimony, philosophy in exile, or
religion in death.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> He expired in the crater of an extinct volcano—a
suitable sepulchre for one who had grown up amid revolution, storms,
political earthquakes, and the thunders of war. His ashes, which reposed
in peace during twenty years, have been exhumed from the grave, and
cast like a fire-brand upon a huge pile of the most inflammable and destructive
combustibles that were ever amassed for the explosion of another
moral volcano!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Paci funesta dies! en tristia erynnis—</div>
<div class="verse">Atlantiaca pulsa resurgit humo!</div>
<div class="verse">Ecce alias tœdas Helenæ, atque incendia Trojæ</div>
<div class="verse">Oceani, oceani prodita claustra vomunt!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was for a nation like France, to demolish the altar of the living God
(to use the words of Montalivert) to make room for the ashes of a Deist
dead!</p>

<p>While memory retraces the page of history, written in blood on the
smiling landscape beneath us, the eye rests once more on the pyramidal
block which marks the fall of one of the ablest and best children of the
revolution. Some dastard, under the cover of night, nearly effaced the
word “<span class="smcap">hero</span>,” and substituted for it that of “<span class="smcap">traitor</span>.” Man is judged in
this world by his <i>actions</i>—in the next world by his <i>motives</i>. If <span class="smcap">Moreau</span>
warred against his country, he was a traitor—if he warred against a tyrant,
who usurped the sceptre and destroyed the liberties of his country, he was
a <span class="smcap">patriot</span>.</p>

<p>Taking a last circumspective view of the splendid prospect around us,
we descended from the dome of the cathedral, and bent our steps to the
Catholic church, where high mass was about to be celebrated. Here we
found a sacred precept at once completely violated. “Whom God has
joined let no man separate.” But the wife is here severed from her husband,
and the sister from the brother—for what good purpose I am unable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
to divine. If the two sexes are not allowed to pray together, lest the
scandal of assignations should result, the priesthood of Saxony are as little
acquainted with human nature as they are with the Aborigines of New
Holland.</p>

<p>But what becomes of this regulation, when we see that it only extends
to the <span class="smcap">pit</span>, while in the galleries of this holy opera (for high mass is neither
more nor less than a sacred drama), the ladies and gentlemen are allowed
to listen and laugh—or peradventure to pray, during the service?</p>

<p>The music here is said to be the best in Germany—and I suppose it must
be so. If the object of sacred music be the elevation of the soul to the
highest pitch of religious fervor and devotional enthusiasm, the accomplishment
of that object may be doubted where a multiplicity of violins
and other instruments drown rather than accompany the choir and the
organ. There is, however, one exception to this doubt. When, in the
performance of the solemn <i>requiem</i>, and at the words—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Tuba, mirum spargens sonum</div>
<div class="verse">Per sepulchra regionum,</div>
<div class="verse">Coget omnes ante thronum—</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the trumpet pours its loud notes along the vaulted roof of some lofty
cathedral, which reverberates them on the crowd below, in imitation of the
“<span class="smcap">last trump</span>,” whose awful sounds shall penetrate every grave on this
globe—burst the marble cerements of the tomb—and summon their
shivering tenants to the foot-stool of their God—the effect is almost
magical! And well it may be so. The very idea of such a stupendous
and miraculous event, involving the hopes and fears, the rewards and
punishments, the eternal peace or endless misery of the whole human race,
is sufficiently astounding and overwhelming in itself; but when heightened
by the most artful and gorgeous imitation that human ingenuity could
invent or effect, the impression is beyond description or even conception!</p>

<p>The picture-galleries are the master-lion of Dresden, and as a mere
catalogue of the paintings—not a “catalogue raisonnée”—fills a goodly
octavo volume, the reader may be assured that I will not, even if I could,
inflict on him a critical notice of this celebrated collection, reiterated <i>ad
nauseam</i>, by so many connoisseurs in the art and mystery of the craft.
Would that the pictorial critics would keep their unintelligible jargon and
puzzling lingo to themselves! How many hundreds and thousands of
the visitors of galleries have the cup of enjoyment dashed from their lips,
while admiring paintings, by hearing some pert hypercritic condemn them
as deficient in “depth of shade,” “breadth of colour,” “truth of tint”—or
some arbitrary quality which his brain has engendered to bewilder the
uninitiated, and display his own refinement of taste and judgment! Then
the host of pseudo-critics, who prick up their ears and catch the <i>fiats</i> of
the connoisseur, become actual pests in the galleries, retailing the <span class="smcap">dicta</span> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
their superiors, and scattering doubts and dissentions among the confiding
crowd—</p>

<div class="verse">In vulgum ambiguas.——</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In such a prodigious collection the great majority of pictures must be of
inferior note, and unworthy of attention. There are, however, a vast
number of gems and chef-d’œuvres, and on these, the traveller will, almost
always, find artists (male and female) constantly employed in copying—many
of them for their daily bread—not a few, as amateurs, even of the
highest rank in life. Here, then, are a series of guides, more practical
than all the critics which commit their lucubrations to the press.</p>

<p>Although Saxony is a Protestant <i>state</i>, it is a Catholic <i>kingdom</i>, and
therefore there is a good sprinkling of sacred subjects in the Dresden galleries.
The intentions of delineating the mysteries of our holy religion on
canvas, may be pious, but the attempt to do so is little less than impious.
What required the miraculous power of a Deity to effect, is not likely to
be imitated in oil and colours by the hands of <span class="smcap">man</span>. The great truths of
<span class="smcap">religion</span> are addressed to the heart rather than to the eye—to the internal
feelings rather than to the external senses—to faith rather than to demonstration.
Let the painter beware how he tries to reduce <i>these</i> to sensible
and visible representations!</p>

<p>Be this as it may, the stranger will always find artists and artistes busy
in copying Bellini’s “<span class="smcap">Christ</span>”—Titian’s “Tribute Money”—the same
painter’s “Mistress”—Veccio’s “Virgin and Infant”—P. Veronese’s
“Adoration of the Virgin and Child”—“The Finding of Moses”—Giorgione’s
“Meeting of Jacob and Rachael”—“The Marriage of the Doges
of Venice with the Sea”—the “Four Doctors of the Church,” by Dosso
Dossi—Raphael’s “<span class="smcap">Madonna de san Sisto</span>,” the jewel of the gallery,
which was bought for £8000—Corregio’s “Virgin and Child”—the
“Virgin and Infant in the Manger,” the second gem of Dresden paintings,—the
“Recumbent Magdalene”—“the Sacrifice of Isaac,”—“Venus
and Bacchus”—Rubens’ “Descent of the Fallen Angels”—Van Dyk’s
“Charles I. and Family”—Rembrandt’s “Own Self and Wife”—Poussin’s
“Discovery of Moses in the Bullrushes”—Claud’s “Acis and Galatea,”
&amp;c. These and scores of others are in perpetual transition from the walls
of the galleries to the easels of the copyists—hence a common complaint
that such collections as these give the highest encouragement to imitators,
and almost annihilate originality.</p>

<h4>THE GREEN VAULTS.</h4>

<p>This royal toy-shop—this magnificent museum of costly curiosities, might
satiate the eyes and appetites of all the Arabian princes and princesses—of
all the Persian shaws and Peruvian monarchs, that ever lived—nay, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
might leave the <span class="smcap">Grand Mogul</span> himself (could his court be re-established
in Hindostan) nothing to wish for or want!</p>

<p>“Whoever,” says an intelligent traveller, “takes pleasure in the glitter
of precious stones—in gold and silver, wrought into all sorts of royal ornaments,
into every form, however grotesque, that art can give them,
<i>without any aim at either utility or beauty</i>, will stroll with satisfaction through
the apartments of this gorgeous toy-shop. They are crowded with crowns
and jewels, and regal attire of a long line of Saxon princes;<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>—vases and
other utensils seem to have been made merely as a means of expending
gold and silver—the shelves glitter with caricatured urchins, whose bodies
are often formed of huge pearls, or of egg-shells, to which are attached
limbs of enamelled gold. One is dazzled by the quantity of gems and
precious metals that glare around him:—he must even admire the ingenuity
which has fashioned them into so many ornaments and unmeaning
nick-nacks. But there is nothing that he forgets more easily, or that deserves
less to be remembered.”</p>

<p>Mr. Russell’s opinion has been cavilled at, as not giving sufficient praise
to the merit of patience labour and skill that have been expended on this
royal collection. If these had resulted in things that were either useful
or ornamental, the merit might have been granted; but neither the one nor
the other has been the consequence of an expense equal to that of the
national debt. The best exception to this general censure is—“the <span class="smcap">Court
of the Great Mogul</span>,” representing the Emperor <span class="smcap">Aurengzebe</span> upon his
throne, surrounded by his guards and courtiers, in appropriate costumes,
according to the description of Tavernier. There are 132 figures, all of
pure enamelled gold, which cost <span class="smcap">Dinlinger</span> eight years’ labour, and the
Saxon treasury eighty-five thousand dollars! This is decidedly the most
elaborate and meritorious work in the Green Vaults; but is it more so than
that which was proposed by <span class="smcap">Dinocrates</span>—the carving of Mount <span class="smcap">Athos</span>
into a statue representing Alexander? I think the latter was the more
noble of the two. The Macedonian project would have given occupation
and subsistence to tens of thousands of labourers for half a century—the
<i>materials</i> being barren rock. The Saxon enterprize occupied only one man
for eight years—the material being pure gold, and precious jewels. But
as men, women and children will run after pretty baubles, glittering gewgaws,
and rare curiosities—and as a tax of one shilling a head is levied in
the Green Vaults, a tolerable revenue is derived from this royal shew-shop,
independent of the constant influx of wealth from the legions of
travellers that ascend and descend the Elbe. It is but justice to acknowledge
that the curators who attend visitors around these costly treasures,
are polite and accomplished gentlemen, who speak various languages, and
are ever ready to afford the fullest information on every subject. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
vaults, the picture-galleries, and armoury, &amp;c. are open every day in the
week to the public.</p>

<h4>RUSTKAMMER.</h4>

<p>If a tour through the Green Vaults excites reflections on the ingenuity
which man has evinced in carving inanimate materials into the shapes and
forms of various living things, an inspection of the immense armoury here,
is calculated to call forth emotions of a very different description! Here we
find the ingenuity of man exerted and tortured in the invention of innumerable
deadly weapons by which his fellow man may be carved into fragments,
pierced with wounds, or battered into mummies!<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> The Rustkammer
certainly leaves the Tower of London at immeasurable distance in the rear,
not only for the variety of instruments used in general warfare, but for
those which were employed in tilts, tournaments, and the chase. Here we
see not merely the arms of the feudal ages, but the horses, the knights
themselves, and all the trappings and accoutrements thereunto belonging.</p>

<p>The prodigious labour and wealth expended on man, horse, armour, and
trappings, excite our astonishment rather than our admiration. The great
variety of drinking vessels, horns, goblets and cups of all dimensions, and
adapted for all depths of potation, would have charmed the heart of the
Baron of Bradwardine, and, well nigh eclipsed the “<span class="smcap">Blessed Bear</span>” of
that hospitable old Highlander! But what shall we say to the armour of
those days—for instance, that of Augustus the Second, surnamed the
Strong? The French giant, who displayed his powers some years ago, at
the Adelphi theatre, would hardly strut under it, weighing, as it does, more
than two hundred pounds!</p>

<p>It has been observed that—“were Europe thrown back, by the word of
an enchanter, into the middle-ages, Saxony could take the field, with a
duly equipped army, sooner than any other power. We cannot easily form
any idea of the long practice which have been necessary to enable a man
to wear such habiliments with comfort, much more to wield such arms
with agility and dexterity. But the young officers of those days wore
armour almost as soon as they could walk, and transmigrated regularly
from one iron shell into another, more unwieldy than its predecessor, till
they reached the full stature of knighthood, and played at broad-sword,
<i>with the weight of a twelve-pounder on their backs</i>, as lightly as a lady bears
a chaplet of silken flowers on her head in a quadrille.”</p>

<p>The “<i>twelve-pounder</i>” on the back is a pretty considerable bounce, far
outstripping Jonathan’s sea-serpent, since a “twelve-pounder” would
weigh at least fifteen hundred pounds! But let that pass. No discipline
or early tuition would enable a person of the present day to fight in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
armour of the middle-ages. It would require a series of generations
trained in the habits, diet, and manners of those times, to produce a progeny
capable of enduring such coats of mail, or wielding such Herculean
weapons as were in use seven hundred years ago. The present age does
not yield to that of any former period, in heroic deeds or personal courage;
but science now supersedes brute force, and the energies of the brain
amply compensate for diminution of muscular strength.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>As there is but one step from the sublime to the ridiculous—from
solemn tragedy to laughing farce—so are there only a few paces between
the great magazine of toys in the green vaults, and the great magazine
of manslaughter in the Rustkammer. From these depôts we turn away,
more in pity than in admiration, to repositories of a very different kind—those
of the peaceful arts, that mingle with, and contribute to, our domestic
comforts and social enjoyments, and which combine elegance with ornament,
and utility with beauty. Need I allude to the Saxon porcelaine,
celebrated over Europe and the world.</p>

<p>I own that I entertained a secret hope that the number of <i>other</i> lions in
this city would drive <i>this</i> particular one out of the memory of my better-half.
I had three reasons for this hope or wish:—1st, the saving of expense—2d,
of carriage and breakage—3d, of—smuggling! But I had calculated
without my host. Just when we had come to the conclusion, that
we had now seen all the sights, it was suddenly recollected that the best of
all was happily yet in reserve—the porcelaine manufactory! No. You may
as well attempt to drag a lady from Geneva without purchasing trinkets,
as from Dresden without buying China. A compact, however, was signed,
that we were only to enjoy the luxury of viewing the repository, without
encumbering our luggage with any of its precious but brittle wares.
Nevertheless, it happened that some of the articles were found to be so
“dog cheap,” and so pretty withall, that, to leave the Elbe without taking
away some specimens of its renowned manufactures, was considered to be
a kind of travelling solecism, if not a porcelaine suicide! It was urged,
moreover, that the <i>ad valorem</i> duty, at an English Custom-house, would
be—next to <i>nothing</i>. I strongly suspect that this prophecy, like many
others, tended to fulfill itself, and that the <i>duty</i> was, as predicted, next to
<i>nothing</i>!</p>

<p>We had been bored, for some days, by the Laquais de Place, to make an
excursion to a place called Tharand, about ten miles from Dresden, a locality
which was represented as the ne plus ultra of all that is sublime and beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
in natural scenery—and moreover, that it was visited by every traveller who
passed through Dresden. So we posted off one fine morning, and arrived at
this valley of Rasselas. We found it situated where three narrow and steep
defiles meet at one point, and where the ruins of an old castle, perched
on a sharp promontory, overlook a small village on one side, a watering-place
on the other, and the road to Dresden in front. The locality has
nothing of the sublime, little of the beautiful, and less of the romantic in
its composition. It is a picturesque spot, but not worth the trouble of
going three miles to see it. The lacquais de place will always endeavour
to eke out an additional day’s boar hunting, when lionizing is at an end.</p>

<p>Of the Dresdenese themselves, it is “not my hint to speak.” They
are like most other people under similar latitudes, institutions, and governments.
Like most continental folks, they are fond of sitting in the open
air, smoking their pipes and sipping their coffee. And no wonder. The
air of the Bruhl Terrace, raised above the Elbe, and commanding a fine
view of the opposite bank, as it stretches away towards Saxon Switzerland,
contrasts wonderfully with the stagnant atmosphere and gloomy
apartments of their own houses. The demolition of the fortifications
round Dresden has given such lungs to the Saxon metropolis as must
greatly increase the longevity of its inhabitants—contrary to what is likely
to occur to the “heroes of the barricades,” who will now be barricaded,
with a vengeance!</p>

<p>Saxony being a favourite pupil of the “Grande Nation,” the “glorious
days of July” were rehearsed on the banks of the Elbe, and a representative
constitution was extorted, without much force, from the king. The conversion
of one archon (mon-arch) into three hundred archons elected by
the people, and forming the “tiers etat,” or house of representatives, did
not realize the golden dreams of the country. On the contrary, as the
odious task of levying taxes was shifted from the shoulders of the king,
who was always economical, to be divided among 300 representatives, the
latter body nearly doubled the taxes, being now mere tools of the court!</p>

<p>However, the Saxons have obtained important privileges, and great
extension of the franchise. Among other valuable rights acquired, by the
people, is that of <i>electing their executioner</i>! This interesting functionary
is considered a kind of gentleman—at least he is an officer of state, which
is next thing to it—and has a house, land, and several perquisites attached
to the office. Among these last is a claim to the bodies of all horses and
cattle that die a natural death. This revenue from hoofs, horns, and hides,
is said to be very considerable. It would be equally amusing and edifying
to hear the professions and promises of the candidate for <i>headsman</i><a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> delivered
from the hustings, during the canvass. One of the promises or
temptations held out by this “limb of the law”—this “<i>sharp</i> practitioner”—this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
member of the <i>executive</i>—would, doubtless, be that, should any of
his constituents honour him with their custom, he would be happy to <i>serve</i>
them, on the shortest notice, on the most liberal terms, and with the utmost
<i>dispatch</i>!</p>

<h4>DRESDEN to LEIPZIG.</h4>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Swift as <span class="smcap">Camilla</span> scours along the plain—</div>
<div class="verse">So darts on iron wings the thundering <span class="smcap">train</span>.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The steam-engine possesses the all but miraculous power of contracting
space and expanding time. Thus, it compresses the sixty-two miles between
Dresden and Leipzig into fifteen miles—while it enables a three
hours’ run by rail to throw off an expansion of ten spare hours to see the
great emporium of books on the banks of the Estler, which hours would
otherwise be spent in traversing the most monotonous road that ever man
or beast drew their weary limbs along! Corn, corn, nothing but corn, or
the bare stubble from which it was cut, meets the tired eye between the
city of the pallet and the city of the pen. We become as sick, indeed,
of wheat and oats, as the unwashed artisan of Birmingham is of the laws
that confine these oceans of grain to the banks of the Elbe and the Vistula,
instead of being diffused through the factories and work-shops of
England—to appease the hunger and invigorate the limbs of a dense and
manufacturing population. The rapidity of the train, the clanking of the
machinery, the belching of steam, the evolution of smoke, and the scattering
of burning cinders, render the three hours’ journey bearable enough.
There is but one long tunnel, (between Dresden and Magdeburg) through
which the train runs and roars and spits its fires—while at another place,
it leaps clean over the river Elbe! A rail-road in the North of Germany
is quite an oasis in the desert. One hundred and forty miles from Dresden
to Magdeburg, with Leipzig in the centre, occupy only seven or eight
hours, instead of three or four toilsome days by the snail-post.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 id="LEIPZIG">LEIPZIG.</h3>

<p>Having had a good deal—perhaps too much—to do with books, I had
some curiosity to see this great mart of <span class="smcap">buckhandlungs</span>—at once the
cradle and the grave of literature! The first thing that strikes the stranger
is the eternal “<span class="smcap">buckhandlung</span>” over every second door in the city.
The next, is the paucity of carriages—a drowsky or a private vehicle being
rarely visible. The third object is perpetually reminding us, not without
sighs and groans, of the smooth trottoirs over which we were wont to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
glide in modern Babylon. Of all the towns through which I have limped
and hobbled in my journey of life, Leipzig bears the palm for maiming
and laming the unfortunate visitor, by means of its sharp stones and uneven
pavée. I wonder that the seven-leagued and iron-shod boots of
the students, together with the innumerable tomes of <i>heavy literature</i> that
are biennially carted through the streets of Leipzig, have not ground off
the angles from the said stones. Yet they have not.</p>

<p>As I was unwilling to do the penance of Peter Pindar’s pilgrim, I directed
my steps to the observatory, and mounted its highest balcony, when
Leipzig and its contiguous battle-field lay stretched beneath me. The
astronomer kindly pointed out the topography of the city and its vicinity,
with minute details of the great combat which he himself had witnessed.
Leipzig is a curious compound of the modern and the antique—one side
being new and the other old. But in every street, bustle and business
went on, while on every countenance thought and reflection were so visibly
painted that one would suppose the whole of the books that came to
the two fairs were studied by the inhabitants. The demolition of the fortifications
has secured the Leipzigers two things—the presence of healthful
walks, and the absence of bloody sieges—blessings and curses which
the Parisians seem neither to desire nor dread. Cities should never be
converted into fortresses. The extent of the works and the number of the
people are causes of weakness and not strength. A fortress should only
contain soldiers, who can lay in provisions against long investment, and on
whom, not on citizens, the horrors of war should fall.</p>

<p>I have said that this city is the cradle of literature. No biblio-parturient
author in Germany would think of being confined, and delivered of
his bantling of the brain, without the aid of a Leipzig accoucheur.
Whether his cerebro-gestation may have lasted nine months, or, as Horace
directs—as many years—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Nonum prematur in annum,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Mr. Brockhaus, or some of his obstetrical brethren in Leipzig, must usher
the “<span class="smcap">nouveau né</span>” into light.</p>

<p>But I have also said that Leipzig is the grave as well as the cradle of
literature, or rather of its authors. At every fair there is a number of
fairies on the look out for every promising birth, which is immediately
kidnapped—wrested from its lawful parents—and sold in distant markets!
In other words:—whenever a work of merit, or apparent merit, appears in
the Leipzig fair, it is pounced upon by literary sharks and vultures from
Frankfort, Wirtemburg, and other places, and instantly reprinted for the
benefit of those who have gone to no outlay in brains or money! It is in
vain that authors and publishers complain. The <i>former</i> are told that,
although they have pocketed nothing by their long literary toil, they have
earned reputation, which is greatly superior to sordid gold; while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
publishers are laughed at for their foolish speculations! Hence it is, that
authors of the most splendid talents and universal renown, are often forced
to publish by subscription—a mode that would damn, or at least, degrade
them in the eyes of a British public. It may be said that—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“All partial ill is universal good,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and that, though authors and booksellers are defrauded, the public are
gainers. But private industry is as deserving of protection as private property—and
there can be no doubt that many men of great talent and
learning are discouraged by these piracies, and deterred from embarking in
literary labours. This uncertainty too prevents all liberal outlay on paper
and type, both of which are disgracefully bad in Germany.</p>

<p>Leipzig is not without interesting associations and reminiscences. But
some of the historical are too remote—some too recent—to be dwelt on
here. The poetical are too extravagant—and the literary too mystified for
much notice in this place. Yet we cannot bid adieu to this cradle and
grave of literature, without a passing thought on two of its magnates—Gottsched
and Klopstock—the <i>former</i>, the father of modern German
learning—the <i>latter</i>, the Goliath of the same. Gottsched was born to be
a great man—for his stature was such that he abandoned, through pure
modesty, his native land, and took refuge in Leipzig, lest he should be
promoted to the rank of a grenadier in the army of Frederick the Great.
There he claimed the character of an universal genius, acting, at once, the
philosopher, grammarian, critic and poet. But his body was bigger than
his brains, and he is now consigned to oblivion—perhaps unjustly so. His
language then (1740-60) was just emerging from barbarism. It was a
period of transition, and shewed no signs of vigorous life. “He introduced
a more cultivated style—attacked pedantic extremes—and excited
useful controversy.”</p>

<p>Passing over Schlegel, Gellert, and other literary lions of Leipzig, we
must bear in mind that it was from this mart of learning that the great
Klopstock, like a huge gymnatus electricus, caused Europe to vibrate by
the birth of his Messiah. “It roused all Germany from Leipzig to its
circumference; and Bodmer, from the valleys of Switzerland, hailed its
author as the morning-star of a new æra.”</p>

<h4>RETROSPECTIVE VIEW FROM THE TOWER OF THE OBSERVATORY.</h4>

<p>He must be a stoic, or something more, who can stand on this time-worn
tower, without recalling to mind those stupendous events which occurred
a quarter of a century ago, around the base of the building. No event,
ancient or modern, can at all compare with the battles around Leipzig, in
Oct. 1814: whether we look to the magnitude of the armies—the discipline,
valour, and enthusiasm of the men—the talents and skill of the commanders—or
the momentous object for which they fought. Six crowned heads—three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Emperors and three Kings—were present at these terrific conflicts,
and witnessed the carnage and havoc among <span class="smcap">five hundred thousand</span>
soldiers engaged for several days and nights in mortal combat!! This was
not the undisciplined rabble, or the effeminate retinue of an Oriental
despot, crossing the Hellespont in pride and ignorance; but veterans from
every country between the mountains of Norway and the mouths of the
Danube—between the Atlantic on the West and Siberia in the East.
These battles were not for mere victory, or to decide some political quarrel
between two or more states. No. It was for the very existence of sceptres—for
the independence or subjugation of every empire and kingdom
in Continental Europe. The struggle was between the oppressor and the
oppressed—between Napoleon the aggressor, and the allied Sovereigns, as
defenders of their crowns, hearths, and altars. The one army had the
disgrace of a hundred defeats to obliterate and avenge—the other the
laurels of a hundred victories to preserve and sustain. The French fought
for the glory of their country, or rather of their Emperor, and the conquest
of Europe—the Allies, for the liberation of their soil from thraldom, and
the repulsion, if not the deposition, of a tyrant invader.</p>

<p>Such a prodigious accumulation and concentration of martial hosts,—excited,
agitated, and impelled by the fiercer passions of our nature—by
ambition, hatred, and revenge—portended the approach of some great
crisis in the affairs of the world. The feeling on both sides was, evidently,
“aut Cæsar aut nullus.” The grand crisis was indeed at hand. The
benignant <span class="smcap">Star</span> of Peace and Justice was about to rise, in splendour, from
the East;—while the malignant <span class="smcap">Meteor of War</span>, that had scattered, for
twenty years, plague, pestilence and famine over a groaning world, was
about to descend from its bad eminence, and be extinguished for ever in
the Atlantic surge.</p>

<p>Napoleon, with all his strength of mind, was superstitious; having
some peculiar notions about fate, and destiny, and stars and fortune—as
though these imaginary beings had any power to control the laws of Nature,
or interfere between cause and effect, whether in the moral or
physical world.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that, when, in the night of the 15th October,
Napoleon saw three “<span class="smcap">death-rockets</span>” rise from the southern horizon,
streaming their pale but brilliant light high through the Heavens—and,
when, immediately afterwards, he beheld four blood-red meteors springing
up far far to the northward, indicating too plainly that the signal from the
grand Austro-Russian army in the South was answered by the Swedo-Prussian
in the North, his moral courage may have experienced a momentary
depression, and his superstition an alarm! There was little time,
however, for reflection. Action, action was soon required. At the dawn
of day the Austro-Russian army attacked the whole southern front of the
French position with great fury but no success. Six desperate attempts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
were reiterated, one after the other—but all failed! This was discouraging
enough—worse remained behind. The moment of exhaustion among
the allied troops was seized upon by Napoleon, who, by one gigantic effort,
pierced and penetrated the very centre of the allied line, while Murat,
Maubourg, and Kellerman, dashed through the gap with the whole of the
cavalry! At this moment of frightful peril, when the torrent of French
troops was pouring through the fatal breach with irresistible impetuosity,
shouting and exulting in the successful exploit, <span class="smcap">Alexander</span> called to his
faithful Cossack guards, and pointing to the column of French cavalry that
was thundering forward in the rear of the allies, addressed a few, and but
a few words to them—probably not dissimilar from those of our own poet,
at another terrific combat—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent8">——on ye brave,</div>
<div class="verse">Who rush to glory or the grave—</div>
<div class="verse">Wave, Cossacks! all your banners wave!</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And charge with all your chivalry!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The valorous Pulk right well fulfilled the emperor’s order. The “furious
Huns” sprang, like tigers, on the “fiery Franks,” and not only charged
and checked the headlong torrent, but rolled back the dense mass of
cavalry at the point of their spears, with destructive carnage, through the
opening by which it had penetrated the Austro-Russian line. Thus, at
the moment when all appeared lost for the allies, a handful of semi-savages
from the banks of the Don overwhelmed the finest body of French horse
that ever paraded on the banks of the Seine—and that with the King of
Naples at its head!</p>

<p>After this rebuff, the fickle goddess forsook her favourite child! The
assailing armies hemmed in, closer and closer, the contracting circles of
Napoleon’s troops, and after days of ineffectual struggles to revive a sinking
cause, the hero of a hundred victories was obliged to sue for an armistice!
No answer being returned, the mortified emperor prepared for
retreat. But even here Fortune turned her back on him. The Saxon
troops threw off their allegiance, and even fired on their former companions
in arms, while endeavouring to extricate themselves from the western gate
of Leipzig! The only bridge, too, by which they could escape, was blown
up by mistake, while twenty-five thousand Frenchmen were left prisoners
on the other side! Napoleon with difficulty reached the western bank of
the Estler—Poniatouski was drowned in that muddy ditch—and a mere
wreck of the Gallic army reached the Rhine. From that day, the star of
Napoleon descended till its light was quenched for ever in the western
wave! Of all the auxiliaries and mercenaries which various passions,
propensities, necessities, or interests had attracted round the standard of
the victorious emperor, <span class="smcap">one only</span> remained true to its trust in the memorable
retreat from Leipzig! Italians, Bavarians, Saxons, Swedes—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>It may not require any great fortitude to meet the scowl or scorn of
our enemy, whether conqueror or conquered; but he must have nerves of
iron who can look in the face of <i>friend betrayed</i>. The sight of the gallant
and deceived Poles, bearing nobly the hardships and miseries of a disastrous
flight, might have wrung tears of remorse from Napoleon’s eyes. But he
had no heart. Egotism was the nutriment on which even his ambition
fed. What said he, when viewing the wretched remains of his army when
it halted at Erfurt, on the 23d of October? “<i>They are a set of scoundrels,
who are going to the devil.</i>” Retributive justice ordained that <span class="smcap">he himself</span>
should not be far behind them!</p>

<p>The Tower of the Observatory stands close to the Estler and the scene
of the dreadful evacuation of the town, the death of Poniatouski, and the
blowing up of the bridge. It also commands a view of most of the theatres
of operations during the successive battles, besides an excellent bird’s-eye
view of the town itself. No one should fail to visit this spot, and recall
the mighty events which occurred around it.</p>

<h4>MAGDEBURG to HAMBURG.</h4>

<p>A good railroad whisks us along, through monotonous corn-fields, from
Leipzig to Magdeburg, in three or four hours. This is the strongest fortification
(always excepting Kœnigstein) on the Elbe—and contains more
than fifty-thousand people, garrison and all. It is, or rather <i>was</i>, in
Saxony; but, thanks to the auspices of Napoleon, in favour of his pet of
Dresden, it is now Prussian, and likely to be long so. It is of immense
extent, and would require thirty or forty thousand men to defend it—consequently
double that number to invest it. As all great virtues are assailed
by virulent abuse, so all strong cities are honoured with long sieges. The
history of Magdeburg should be printed and posted on the gates of Paris.
It has had its ups and downs in its day. It was besieged many a time,
and sometimes taken. Although it repulsed the famous Count Wallenstein,
in the thirty years’ war, it fell, after two years’ siege, before the magnanimous
Tilley (1631), who sacked the city; but in his humanity, spared the
whole of the inhabitants—except <span class="smcap">thirty thousand</span>, whom he massacred,
without distinction of age or sex!! These are among the “splendid
miseries” to which fortified towns and cities have been entitled, time immemorial—from
the days of Alexander and <span class="smcap">Titus</span>, to those of Napoleon
and Wellington—from the sacred heights of Solyma, to the sandy plains
of Haerlem! This doubtful glory—this dangerous pre-eminence, appears
to be the height of a great people’s ambition—though it is probable that
a nation’s strength has more in its moral courage and physical energies,
than in dead walls and deep ditches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>A steamer starts at five o’clock every morning from Magdeburg to
Hamburg, and when the Elbe is not very low, the passage may be performed
in one day. But fortunately, or unfortunately, we had not had a wet day, or
hardly a cloud in the sky, from the day we left London, till our return to that
metropolis, and therefore the river was so shallow, that we were forty-eight
hours on the voyage. There never was a vessel that had a greater partiality
for the ground than ours—and when once her keel and the sand came in
contact, it was as difficult to separate them as to disengage two furious
mastiffs joined in mortal combat. Our captain, too, had a singular method
of loosening his vessel from her hold on the shoal. Instead of carrying
out an anchor astern, and dragging her off in that direction, as we drag
dogs from one another by their tails, he invariably took the anchor out
a-head, and after prizing the vessel as far forward on the bank as possible,
he then tried the retrogressive plan, and, of course, succeeded, though sometimes
after two or three hours’ delay. At length we came to a dead stop—for
there was not three feet water in any part of the river; so we were
obliged to shift into another steamer, “<i>below bar</i>” and jogged along, as
above the barrier, but more of our time passed aground than afloat.
However, we had a very pleasant society on board—people from various
countries—very good table-d’hôte—but, as the weather was fine, and the
berths close and crowded, I picked out the softest plank I could find on
deck, and slept in the open air, during our descent of the Elbe. There is
little or no improvement of the scenery between Dresden and the mouth
of the river. The Elbe pays a heavy fine in the shape of monotony for
its short but romantic route through Saxon Switzerland!</p>

<h4>HAMBURG.</h4>

<p>From the muddy wharves and quays, we scramble up through steep
streets, every second house having an inscription, or rather an advertisement
in English on its walls or over the door Of the Babel tongues that
salute the ear in every part of this city, the English seems to hold the next
rank to German and Dutch. Whether it was from the lowness of the
Elbe, and the long drought, I know not, but the canals that penetrate far
up several of the streets, appeared abominably filthy and malodorous.
Three-fourths indeed of their bottoms were bare of water, and only exhibited
reeking mud, well impregnated with all kinds of animal and vegetable
debris, and admirably calculated to spread pestilential disorders
through the city.</p>

<p>At length we got to what might be termed “the West End,” though it
is here the North or North-East quarter, and the scene is entirely changed.
We find ourselves, all at once, on the borders of a spacious lake, which is
narrowed in the middle, and spanned there by a bridge, exhibiting on its
surface numerous pleasure-boats, and on its banks a succession of handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
buildings. Shaded walks and terraces are constructed along the shores,
so that these lakes (for they may be considered as two formed by a bridge)
really present a most refreshing picture to the eye in Summer, and furnish
a magnificent skating-plain in Winter. The levelled fortifications are now
converted into superb and extensive promenades, gardens, and shrubberies,
exhibiting a pleasing contrast to the endless batteries, fosses, and bastions
of Magdeburg and other fortified towns. No city or town on the Continent,
that I have seen, presents anything like the <span class="smcap">bustle</span> of <span class="smcap">business</span> that
is going forward in every street of Hamburg. Leipzig is nothing to it,
since it wants all the elements and materiel of maritime commerce. The
great hotels face the lake (which, by the bye, is a monstrous dam formed
by a dribbling stream, the Alster) and the <i>Salles-a-Manger</i> there, shew us
that we are almost clean out of Germany, and nearly in the heart of old
England. The table-d’hôte is at four o’clock, where good substantial
joints and dishes dance merrily round the table, and are eagerly demolished
by stomachs sharply whetted on the exchange, the bureaus, warehouses,
and shops of this most singular entrepôt of European merchandize; The
Hamburghers and Leipzigers appear to belong to the class of ruminating
animals, who flock to the table-d’hôte for the purpose of swallowing, or
rather bolting their dinners, dispensing entirely with the process of mastication,
and leaving the triple functions of rumination, digestion, and calculation
to go on simultaneously, not successively, by which many hours
of valuable time are daily gained for the dispatch of business. I will not
maintain that this bolting system, followed by the hard labour of two important
organs, the head and the stomach, at one and the same time, is
equally as well calculated for the preservation of health as for the accumulation
of wealth; but probably it is not more insalubrious than the
ennui, the inertion, the eternal pipe, and the poisonous dishes of the noncommercial
Germans in general.</p>

<p>It is upon the same principle of economy of time, and division of labour,
that the Hamburghers hire professed mourners to weep and wail over their
deceased relatives. By this ingenious procedure the business of the living
is not interrupted by the departure of the dead—perhaps not even on—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">The first dull day of nothingness—</div>
<div class="verse">The last of suffering and distress!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the Hamburghers levelled their fortifications to the ground, they
took care to leave certain portals or barriers standing, by which they might
be enabled to levy contributions on—“the stranger within their gates,”
as well as on those who are outside. The nocturnal tax on ingress and
egress increases with every hour after sunset, and the bustle and confusion
occasioned by the embarkations and debarkations of steam-travellers with
their luggage, baffle all description. The drowskies and their cads,
the porters and their wads, the janitors, the police, and the watermen—all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
jumbled in the darkness of the night about the water-gate of the city—all
vociferating in the most discordant jargon; but all united in the strictest
harmony of action, as to one operation—the patriotic endeavour to empty
the passengers’ purses of every stray mark that might be encumbering their
pockets—such a scene is not easily delineated, nor will it be forgotten!</p>

<p>A good steamer, fair weather, and a pleasant company, rendered a forty-eight
hours’ run to modern Babylon an agreeable variety in the chequered
scenes of a long tour.</p>

<span class="smaller">OF</span><br />
GERMANY AND THE GERMANS.</h3>

<p>Having now brought my various perambulations (at various times) through
Germany to a close, it might be thought possible that a traveller could form
some definite idea—or draw some distinctive character of the people themselves.
This is more easy in theory than in practice. If an intelligent Japanese
were conveyed through the air to Connaught or Kerry, and dropped there
for a month, to observe the manners, habits, and character of the inhabitants:—if
he were thence deposited in Yorkshire, for an equal time—then
among the mountains of Wales—and finally in the Highlands of Scotland:
and if, after all this, “he returned to the place from whence he came,” and
was asked for some characteristic sketch of the British nation, he would
be not a little puzzled. In the first place, he would assert that he had
visited four nations, differing as much from each other as the shamrock
differs from the rose, or the thistle from the leek. They differed in appearance,
language, dress, manners, diet, drink, avocations—soil—climate—and,
for aught he knew, in religious creeds. If pressed for some one characteristic
common to all, he might be tempted to reply that the only one
thing in which they all agreed was—<i>to eat potatoes</i>. However varied were
the other component parts of their food, they all <i>ate potatoes</i>. Now if,
within the narrow boundary of the British Isles, we find such diversity
among their inhabitants, what may we expect in that huge democracy of
autocracies that stretches from the Baltic to the Adriatic—from the banks
of the Rhine to the confines of the Russ—which extends over a surface
of fifty thousand square miles—bears a population of 38 millions of souls—and,
what is still more remarkable, sustains a weight of 38 sovereignties,
of all shapes and sizes, from Imperial Austria, of 12,000 square miles,
down to the principality of Lichtenstein, covering the enormous area of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
ten or eleven! Throughout these vast and varied territories, there is diffused
all the varieties of physical organization, moral temperament, and
intellectual capacity, characteristic of the great European family. And
yet there is a certain degree of family likeness in these 38 sovereignties,
that can hardly be mistaken.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent6">——Facies non omnibus una,</div>
<div class="verse">Nec diversa tamen.——</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>1. <i>Physiognomy.</i>—The large head, the square face, the blue eyes, the
honest countenance, the solemn gait, the modest mein, and the punctilious
manners of the German, are everywhere conspicuous.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Language.</i>—This, it must be confessed, is grating enough to the
ear; but it is far more disagreeable to the eye! When will Germany
discard that barbarous, or at least Gothic system of hieroglyphics, by which
bad paper is disfigured by worse type! There is something so singular,
not to say startling, in the German language, that if a mummy who had
slept in one of the Pyramids since the days of Sesostris were to awake
among a mixed company of antiquarian unrollers, the German tongue
would surely be the first to tickle its withered ears.</p>

<p>3. <i>Ideology.</i>—The Germans are great dreamers—magnificent dreamers.
The Italian may imagine, the Frenchmen invent, the Spaniard may ruminate,
and the Dutchman may calculate; but it is the German who can
<span class="smcap">dream</span> while wide awake. A German will dream you a dream, as long
(to use a nautical phrase) as the main-top-bow-line; or rather as an epic
poem, and as full of reality as the latter.</p>

<p>4. If the four British races were unanimous only in one thing—the
eating of potatoes;—the 38 sovereignties beat them in this respect. All
ranks and classes smoke tobacco—and both sexes devour sour-krout, grease,
and vinegar.</p>

<p>5. The <span class="smcap">Patience</span> of the German is proverbial. He is patient in politics,
affliction, adversity—and, what is still more commendable, in <i>prosperity</i>.
Hence he wins and loses at the gaming-table with more equanimity than
any other man.</p>

<p>6. In <span class="smcap">Religion</span>, Germany presents nearly as many creeds as principalities.
These, however, shoot forth from the Reformed Church. Popery is
too poor a soil for the growth of “heresies and schisms.” It will not bear
a plurality of faiths. If Catholicism be not the true belief, we must admit
that Catholics are the true believers. Of all the deviations from the
Protestant Church in Germany, <i>Rationalism</i> and <i>Scepticism</i> are the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
prominent and dangerous. Speaking of the latter, Dr. Hawkins observes:—“We
must anticipate, however reluctantly, that, not only in Germany,
but in some other parts of Europe, the heaviest calamity impending over
the whole fabric of society is the lengthening stride of bold Scepticism.”
And, after describing the tenets of the <span class="smcap">Rationists</span>, the same authority
remarks:—“They consequently disclose to us the frightful fact, that all
the essential doctrines of Christianity are unreservedly rejected.” A question
might here be asked: is this widespreading state of no belief—of no
religion—preferable to Catholicism, mixed up with a few superstitions and
errors?</p>

<p>We hear constant complaints that Popery is on the increase. How can
it be otherwise? Where and when was <span class="smcap">union</span> not a source of strength,
and <span class="smcap">division</span> of weakness? The Protestant <i>High</i> Church is like a brilliant
meteor shooting through the air in splendour and brightness; but
constantly detaching from its own body some vital elements of its own
existence. The Catholic Church, on the other hand, is like a snow-ball
rolling along the ground, with apparent humility, a dense and cohesive
mass, alike tenacious of that which it possesses, and attractive of that
which falls in its way.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>7. <i>Affability.</i>—I have before remarked, and it is remarked by all travellers,
that, in no part of Europe or the world, are affability, amenity, and
suavity of manners, in social intercourse, more conspicuous among all
classes, orders, genera, and species of society, than in Germany; or a more
complete absence of all prominent or repulsive distinction of ranks. I
endeavoured to account for this by education, habit, and example. But
there is one other cause adduced by Dr. Hawkins, which I overlooked—the
numerous sovereignties and states into which Germany is divided, the very
inter-collisions of which tend to preserve a smoother surface, and a greater
equilibrium of urbanity, than under one great monarchy, or even republic.
I shall attempt to illustrate this moral phenomenon by a physical one. Let
us take two small and tranquil lakes, one to represent England, and the
other Germany. Let a large stone be dropped into the centre of the
<i>former</i>, and we shall quickly observe a series of waves or undulations,
rolling in excentric circles to the remotest edges of the water, in every
direction—all parallel, all close to each other, but never touching or mingling.
This exactly represents the gradations of rank, classes, professions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
avocations in England. They diverge from the central monarchy in
parallel lines down to the peasant—always in close approximation; but
never touching or amalgamating.</p>

<p>Into the other lake, let 38 stones, of various shapes and sizes (corresponding
with the 38 sovereignties) be precipitated in as many different
parts of the glassy mirror. What shall we see? Not the series of distinct
waves rolling from centre to circumference—but a chequered surface where
one undulation is broken, crossed, or neutralized by another, and where
large or definite circles of waves are nowhere perceptible. The application
of this simile to German society requires no explanation.</p>

<p>8. <i>Education.</i>—It is acknowledged that, in no other country is education
so cheaply and amply provided as in Germany. It is remarked by
Dr. Hawkins, that the <i>results</i> of education in Germany and in England,
are very different. In the <i>former</i>, the student is almost entirely engrossed
by the physical and practical sciences—whilst the English one is very
much occupied with theology, morality, classics, poetry, and rhetoric.
“Yet in the end, the Englishman becomes most practical, and the German
the most theoretical and sentimental.” With all due deference to Dr.
Hawkins, I doubt or rather deny the fact, that the practical <i>education</i> of
the German renders him theoretical: or that the theoretical <i>education</i> of
the Englishman makes him practical. Will Dr. H. maintain that a good
education in the physical and practical sciences would convert an Englishman
into a theorist or sentimentalist? No, it would not. It is not the
education, but the different circumstances in which the two people are
placed, after leaving the schools, that produce the contrast noticed by
Dr. Hawkins. A complaint is made that this facility of education leads
to surplus candidates for professional honours; and the German governments
endeavour to divert the aspirants into other channels than the learned
professions. But where is there <i>not</i> this surplus? In England, where
education is expensive enough, the ranks of the church, bar, and medicine,
are crowded to suffocation. Two causes of this operate in Germany.
The cheapness of education—and the cheapness of living afterwards.—Two
or three in England—the redundancy of population, and the choaking
up of the war-channels, those waste-pipes and safety-valves of society.
To these may be added the restless ambition of the shopocracy to push
some of their sons into the carriage from behind the counter.</p>

<p>A considerable portion of the English consider that education (among
the lower classes) without a particular creed, is worse than no education
at all. The real, though not the acknowledged meaning of this is, that
education, or knowledge, is, in the abstract, or <i>per se</i>, an evil rather than a
good. It would be much better to openly and candidly maintain this doctrine
at once, than mystify it under the term “religious instruction,” that
is, instruction combined with a <i>particular</i> creed. An ingenious casuist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
might easily shew—perhaps prove—the truth of the anti-education doctrine.
Beginning with the Garden of Eden, he might quote Scripture
that knowledge first</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Brought death into this world, and all our woe.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And descending along the stream of time, he might adduce proofs that, in
exact proportion as nations advanced in knowledge, they became discontented,
refractory, immoral, and irreligious. But though it is maintained
by the High Church party in England, that a particular creed, without
knowledge, is preferable to knowledge without a particular creed; yet it
is confessed that the <i>latter</i> is not always an infallible corrector of the evil
inherent in learning. We too often find sin and science in those academic
bowers where the thirty-nine Articles are regularly inculcated, and implicitly
believed.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, in Germany, reading, writing, and arithmetic—Greek,
Latin, and mathematics—astronomy, geography, and navigation—anatomy,
physic, and surgery, &amp;c. &amp;c. are taught in public seminaries without reference
to any other creed than that of the general truth of Christianity as
contained in the New Testament.</p>

<p>Some few particulars of the system of education in Prussia, may not be
uninteresting.</p>

<p>Every department has a board of education, which employs school-inspectors,
residing in the chief towns. Every circle and parish has also its
school-board—and every school its proper inspectors. The clergyman of
the parish is, <i>ex officio</i>, one of the inspectors. The whole system is under
the cognizance and control of the Minister of <span class="smcap">Public Instruction</span>, assisted
by a Council. The seminaries are divided into—1. Elementary or
Primary Schools—2, Burgher, or Middle Schools—3, Universities.</p>

<p>Parents unable to prove that they can give their children a competent
education at home, are compelled to send them to school at the age of five
years. Masters are obliged to give their servants and apprentices a suitable
education between the seventh and fourteenth year. No child can
be removed from the school till examined by the inspectors. Poor parents
are furnished with the means of sending their children to school. The
schools are supported by endowments—tax upon property—and contributions
from the affluent. The schools are built in healthy places, with playgrounds,
gymnasiums, &amp;c. “The first law of every school is to train up
the young so as to implant in their minds a knowledge of the relation of
man to God—and to excite them to govern their lives according to the
spirit and precepts of Christianity.” The daily occupations begin and end
with a short prayer and some pious reflections. The New Testament shall
be given to those who can read. The more advanced scholars shall have
the Bible. “This book shall also be used for the religious instruction in
all the classes of gymnasiums (or middle schools.)” “Clergymen are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
seize every opportunity, whether at church or on visits of inspection, of
reminding teachers of their high and holy mission, and the scholars of their
duty towards the public instructors.” There are numerous “normal
schools” for training up schoolmasters. Of all the children in Prussia,
between the age of seven and fourteen years, it is calculated that thirteen
out of every fifteen, are educated in the national schools.</p>

<p>9. <i>Learning.</i>—That depth of erudition should be a necessary sequence
of cheap education may admit of question, or, at least of cavil; but one
thing is certain, that, whether as a <i>post hoc</i>, or a <i>propter hoc</i>, this article
is more abundant in Germany than in any other country. Germany is, in
fact, the great European granary of learning—a granary sadly infested
with rats and mice from poorer soils—whole shoals of these vermin being
seen crossing the Rhine annually, with all the voracity evinced by their
forefathers, when in pursuit of the Bishop of Maintz!</p>

<p>But Germany is also a vast <span class="smcap">minery</span>, where thousands are digging in the
dark, during the best years of their lives, extracting the most precious literary
lore from the masses of rubbish in which it lies concealed. Around
the mouths of these mines are always hovering certain birds of prey, of
passage, and of furtive propensities, which, under cover of the night, commit
depredations on the shining ore that is rescued from its grave by the
laborious miner. Among these are the literary cormorant, the gull, the
daw, and the magpie, who no sooner get <i>crammed</i> with the German spoils,
than they fly off to their roosts and nests to exhibit them as the legitimate
produce of their own industry. I have known more than one, two, or
three of these daws who, having plumed themselves in German feathers,
strutted as proudly as if their habiliments had been of genuine indigenous
growth!</p>

<p>The German seems to court, and to cultivate <span class="smcap">learning</span> for the sake of
itself, rather than of its attendant advantages. He climbs the rugged steeps
of science—wanders over the flowery fields of literature—or explores the
dark and mysterious labyrinths of metaphysics—with little hope, and less
prospect of reaping more than empty fame,—and that too often posthumous!
Yet the German is as modest in the profession, as he is industrious
in the pursuit of knowledge. In his patient researches, he is hardly ever
led aside to the right or to the left, by ambition, vanity, or avarice. Truth
is his object—accuracy, impartiality, and laborious research, are the channels
through which he reaches it. Not that he is insensible to honours of
all kinds. On the contrary, like the whole of his countrymen, a ribbon,
a cross, or a star, is to him not only a symbol of distinction but an object
of worship.</p>

<p>The German illuminati, whether literary, philosophic, or scientific, immersed
in their libraries and laboratories, far removed from the excitement
of politics, commerce, arts, or manufactures, not seldom lean to the speculative,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
rather than to the practical—to the mysterious, rather than to the
obvious.—Hence the transcendental dreams and extravagant experiments,
which daily rise, like meteors, from this land of ideality and metaphysics,
soon to dissolve in air—thin air. Yet these eccentricities are not attributable
to peculiarity of education, or idiosyncrasy of constitution; but
to those extrinsic circumstances in which the German is placed.</p>

<p>10. <i>The Press.</i>—The freedom with which this powerful engine is
wielded in the different states of Germany, varies very much. Between
Vienna and Leipzig-liberty of the press, there is nearly as much difference
as between Negro freedom in Virginia and London. But the censorship
exists everywhere. The manuscript of volume, magazine, or newspaper
must first undergo the revisal of the phlegmatic and inexorable <span class="smcap">Censor</span>,
who strikes out or alters every passage or paragraph which has any tendency
to exercise the imagination, excite the feelings, or appeal to the
passions. This at least, is the policy of Austria. Now it would require
but little ingenuity to prove—or at least, persuade, that this is the very
<i>ne plus ultra</i> of good government. What engines are so potent in the
origination and propagation of evil as imagination, feeling, passion? How
praiseworthy is it in the Austrian Emperor to stifle and suppress all combustible
materials of this kind!—How beneficial would the Censorship
prove in England! Take, for instance, the subject of <span class="smcap">libel</span>—so well calculated
to introduce all kinds of hatred and ill-will amongst Britons. The
<span class="smcap">Age</span> or the <span class="smcap">Satirist</span> might, without the possibility of <i>prevention</i>, assert
that “the <span class="smcap">Queen</span> was—anything but a gentlewoman:”—and that “the
Chancellor of the Exchequer was lately <i>detected in picking the pocket</i> of one
of his neighbours on the treasury bench!!” Now if such paragraphs came
before an Austrian Censor, that redoubtable <span class="smcap">official</span> would either erase
them entirely and cite the audacious editor before one of the tribunals, or
substitute something like the following:—“From all parts of the country
congratulatory addresses are pouring in upon her <span class="smcap">Majesty</span>, in consequence
of the recent happy event.” And in respect to the alleged <span class="smcap">pick-pocket</span>,
it would probably run thus:—“The recent financial measure of the Chancellor
of the Exchequer (the imposition of a tax on rent-gatherers), has
given universal satisfaction to all classes of the community—with the exception,
perhaps, of Daniel O’Connel, M.P., who opposed the measure so
stoutly in parliament.”</p>

<p>But the <i>prevention</i> of all sources of excitement and irritation amongst
the community, so much preferable to the <i>punishment</i> of them afterwards,
would not be the only advantage of a shackled, that is, a censored <span class="smcap">press</span>.
The great majority of writers, who, being defective in imagination, feeling,
and passion—in other words, of <span class="smcap">genius</span>—are now consigned to oblivion,
would, under the paternal Austrian system, spring up in myriads, and
greatly tend to render the Plumbean rule of authority a veritable wand of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Mercury, soothing the great mass of society into soporific torpor, and
silencing effectually those turbulent spirits of the age, who stir up men’s
minds to mischief! Away then with those hot-headed enthusiasts who
prefer a “<span class="smcap">libertas periculosa</span>” to the Austro-patriarchal system of
“<span class="smcap">servitudo quieta</span>,” where the fiat of the sovereign is the fate of the
subject!!</p>

<p>Then think of the incalculable benefit that would accrue to society from
the suppression of those myriads of critical and political reviewers, trimestral,
mestral, hebdomadal, and diurnal, who batten and fatten on the vitals
of authors, scattering their quivering members to the winds, or flinging
them about, like firebrands, to inflame the passions of the community! In
fine, till <span class="smcap">princes</span> muzzle the press, there will be no millennium between
them and their <span class="smcap">people</span>.</p>

<p>11. <i>Domestic Manners.</i>—A treatise on the <i>domestic</i> manners of the
French and Germans, is like an essay on the rail-roads of the Alps in the
days of Hannibal—or steam-navigation in the voyage of Nearchus—or
the mariner’s compass in the Periplus of Hanno. Let us hear the testimony
of one who resided long in Germany, and was intimate with their
habits and language.</p>

<p>“The Germans are not so domestic as the English, yet perhaps more so
than the French. The taste of the <i>middle and lower classes</i> carries them
necessarily to public gardens, coffee-houses, the table-d’hôte, and the
theatre. A large portion of the male population dine daily at the table-d’hôte,
and here a considerable portion of their time is dissipated. The
<i>higher orders</i>, in addition to the theatre, derive one of their chief gratifications
from a Summer visit to some of the mineral springs; and here
they live all together in a family manner—entire families at these bathe
dine and sup, and even breakfast in public.”—<i>Bisset Hawkins.</i></p>

<p>It is really no paradox, therefore, to say that an insight into <i>domestic</i>
manners in Germany, will be best acquired in <i>public</i>—where all classes,
high, middle, and lower orders “live and move and have their being!”</p>

<p>12. <i>Women.</i>—Perhaps in no country of Europe (as indeed the preceding
section would indicate) are the barriers around female honour more feebly
raised, or less vigilantly guarded;—yet in no country is female virtue more
free from stain. “Here the temperament of woman is cast in a happy
mould. Gentle, kind, unambitious, unaffected, she is less intent upon
adorning herself, than in administering to the happiness of those around
her. She is fenced round with few artificial restraints; and, in society,
she often meets with too much laxity of opinion and usage. Her full and
confiding heart requires a helpmate on whom to lean through life. This
support granted to her, she generally exhibits all the domestic virtues in
their vernal bloom.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>To this it has been objected that, the number of children born out of
wedlock in Germany, is infinitely greater than in England. Thus, in the
great city of Prague, more than a third of the children born annually are
illegitimate. But mistresses may be virtuous without being married—and
they may be married without being virtuous. In many countries marriage
is only a civil, and not a religious rite. The neglect of that ceremony,
therefore, <i>in such countries</i>, involves neither sin, nor crime, nor disgrace.
The slender <i>liaison</i> of affection is often stronger and more durable than the
massive chains of matrimony. The frequency of these <i>liaisons</i>, therefore,
is to be attributed to the influence of public sentiment, rather than to depravity
of the female heart. The facilities, indeed, of effecting divorce in
many Protestant States of Germany render the tie of marriage little more
than a nominal bond that can be conveniently cancelled, when passions
cool, tempers clash, or interests predominate!</p>

<p>13. <i>Morality.</i>—Although there can scarcely be genuine <span class="smcap">religion</span> without
morality; yet there may be great display of <span class="smcap">morality</span> without religion.
Germany affords a proof and illustration. In no other country is there
less of <span class="smcap">religion</span>—in none is there less of <span class="smcap">crime</span>. The apparent paradox
is easily solved. Crime is punishable by the laws of man, in this world;—irreligion
is punishable by the laws of God, in another. In a country
where little or no religion prevails, and consequently where there is little
or no belief in future rewards and punishments, it may readily be supposed
that the fear of the magistrate is much more efficient than the fear of the
Lord.</p>

<p>14. <i>Socialism.</i>—Smoking is not so sociable an affair in Faderland as in
some other countries. In this respect, indulgence in tobacco presents a
great contrast to that in tea. If you visit a cigar divan in London, or an
estaminet in Paris, you will find “the flow of soul,” if not the “feast of
reason,” in conjunction with the fumes of the “cursed weed.” Not so
beyond the Rhine. The German shrinks within the cloudy atmosphere of
his pipe, like a snail within its shell, and there remains imperturbable,
immoveable, and insensible to the external world. Meanwhile the soul
retires to some remote nook or corner of the brain—probably the pineal
gland—and there taking its metaphysical siesta, dreams of all imaginable
and unimaginable things! This appears to be the real explanation of the
idealism, mysticism, and transcendentalism of the German character.</p>

<p>15. <span class="smcap">Time.</span>—By half the world or more—by all who have much to do,
whether by the head, the hands, or the feet—<span class="smcap">time</span> is regarded next to
health, as the most valuable article: by the other half—or a large portion
of it—<span class="smcap">time</span> is looked upon as little better than a drug, and readily bartered
away for the merest trifles!—Nay, it is often voted to be a great <span class="smcap">bore</span>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
a thousand ways and means are invented to kill the bore. In Germany
<span class="smcap">time</span> is not over-rated, on the one hand, nor despised or hated, on the other.
All Germans have something to do (for who is without his pipe), and few
have very much work on hand. The German, therefore, takes everything
leisurely and coolly—never permitting himself to be hurried or flurried—even
by the sound of the dinner-bell, or the march to the table-d’hôte. It
is seldom of any use to bribe the waiter or the postillion to increased velocity.
The cook and the horses not being participators of the <i>douceur</i>, are
not at all inclined to assist in the completion of the implied contract between
the other parties. The German never attempts to “<span class="smcap">kill time</span>,”
well knowing that in such a conflict the enemy must be ultimately victorious.
But he daily and hourly offers him a <i>narcotic</i>, by which his scythe
may be blunted, and his ravages obscured.</p>

<p>Of all the mythological divinities, <span class="smcap">Time</span> is most familiar to us, through
the medium of his works:—for he himself is invisible, inaudible, intangible.
<span class="smcap">Time</span> is cloathed, on one side, with flesh and blood:—the other is a naked
skeleton. In his right hand he holds a wand, by which he calls into existence,
every instant, countless myriads of beings throughout the animal
and vegetable world—leading them forward to maturity and age. His
skeleton hand is clenched on a crooked falchion, with which he smites,
destroys, and annihilates everything which he had previously created—thus
realizing the fabled monster that eternally devours its own progeny!<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> It
is a melancholy spectacle—but it could not have been otherwise! It is
possible that the Almighty could have created a single pair immortal—but
the power of multiplying could not have been conferred without the penalty
of death!</p>

<p>Tyrannical, inexorable, and pitiless, as he is, yet <span class="smcap">Time</span> is not without
some redeeming qualities. 1mo. He is strictly <i>impartial</i>. He slackens
not his pace at the command of the monarch—he hurries not his steps
at the prayer of the slave. 2do. <span class="smcap">Time</span> mitigates every <i>moral</i> ill that is
unattended with culpability or remorse: and although he too often aggravates
<i>physical</i> maladies, yet he invariably diminishes our sensibility to
pain, and thus tends to reconcile us to our lot of suffering. 3tio. He is
sure to remove from the sphere of their operations all tyrants, oppressors, and
evil-doers; thus giving the world a chance of better successors. 4to. <span class="smcap">Time</span>
is a great enemy to personal beauty, of feature or form—apparently deeming
such qualities to be dangerous accompaniments to length of years. On the
other hand, he is more favourable to virtue, honour, morality, and <span class="smcap">religion</span>,
of which <span class="smcap">time</span> <i>alone</i> never deprives the individual till the curtain falls.</p>

<p>On <span class="smcap">time past</span>, hallowed in memory and mellowed by distance, we look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
back as on an old and valued friend, whom we did not sufficiently appreciate
while living, but who is now lost to us for ever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Time present</span> we too often contemplate through the haze of prejudice,
passion, or impatience; underrating his value, overlooking his flight, and
neglecting the advantages which he offers, till, all at once, we find that
<span class="smcap">time present</span> has changed into <span class="smcap">time past</span>, and vanished from our grasp!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Time to come</span>—is that fairy-land of promise—of air-built castles—of
hopes that are seldom to be realized, of fears that are generally exaggerated—of
phantoms, good and evil, conjured up by imagination on the
dim horizon of our mental vision, which dissolve as we approach, or fly as
we follow!! Yet these phantoms of futurity form the solace and the
misery of half the world!</p>

<p>16. <i>Titles, Decorations, &amp;c.</i>—From the savage, with the ring in his nose—the
serjeant, with the tassel on his shoulder—the prince, with the star
on his breast—up to the monarch, with the diadem on his brow—all and
every of the human race, are nearly insatiable in the pursuit of honours,
titles, distinctions, or decorations. I do not presume to determine what
nation or people most <i>desire</i> these pomps and vanities; but I think it will
be allowed that the Germans are not behind their neighbours in the <i>display</i>
of them. The French may dispute the palm on this point; but I doubt
whether they will gain the victory. <span class="smcap">John Bull</span> appears to be the
least ostentatious of the European family, often pocketing his stars and
garters, when travelling, by which he saves in money what he loses in
eclat.</p>

<p>After all, this weakness of the German and Frenchman is very pardonable.
Those who have <i>fairly</i> earned honours are under no obligation to
conceal them; and those who have not done so, are not called upon to
proclaim the secret—especially as so many of their friends and neighbours
are always ready to kindly perform that office gratuitously.</p>

<p>17. <i>Aerophobia.</i>—From one end of Germany to the other, among all
ages, ranks, and professions, an <i>AEROPHOBIA</i>, or dread of fresh air, universally
prevails! If you take a seat in the diligence or eilwagen, your
German neighbour in the corner closes the windows immediately, lest a
breath of pure air should enter the vehicle. On arriving at the hotel,
half poisoned by the disoxygenated atmosphere of the coach, and enter
your chamber, you find all the windows securely fastened, and the air of
the apartment a mass of heavy mephitic vapour, like that which issues from
a long unopened tomb. If you descend to the spies-saal, where the air is
still farther vitiated by the fumes of tobacco, and throw open a window,
you are stared at by the ober-kellner, the under-kellner, and every “<span class="smcap">gast</span>”
in the “<span class="smcap">haus</span>,” as a person deranged. I had long puzzled my brains to
account for this aerophobic phenomenon, and, at last, traced its cause to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
the <span class="smcap">German stove</span>—that black brewery of mephitism, which, bearing a
mortal antipathy to the fresh air of Heaven, imbues every one who sits
near it with the same prejudice. In fine, the German exhibits as great a
horror of oxygen, as he does a mania for azote!</p>

<p>And what is the consequence of this?—Why, that the Germans are ten
times more susceptible of colds, rheumatism, face-aches, and tooth-aches,
than the English, who live in a far more variable, wet, and ungenial climate.
This aerophobia is one of the causes too, of that sallow, unhealthy
aspect which all Germans, who are not forced to be much in the open air,
exhibit. It is no wonder that they swarm like locusts round their numberless
spas, in the Summer, to wash away some of those peccant humours
engendered by their diet, and fermented by their stoves.</p>

<p>18. <i>Female Peasantry.</i>—Among a barbarous people, we always find that
the weaker sex have the harder work. It is not very flattering nor yet
creditable to the pride of civilization, that in many parts of Europe, and
even in Germany, the female peasant is little more than a beast of burthen,
with worse food and more care than the ox or the horse. Wherever we
see three persons employed in agricultural labour, two of them are sure to
be women. They cut the corn, and thrash out the grain—dig the potatoes,
and carry them home—whilst the large baskets on their backs are filled
with everything that requires transportation from the fields to the house,
or from the house to the fields. One of the most revolting instances of
this female slavery which I have seen, was in Belgium, where, on the line
of the railway, we observed women sitting with large panniers on their
backs, into which the men were shovelling the earth, gravel, and stones, to
be carried away by the females—many of them young women! Every
time that the earth or gravel was thrown into the pannier, the shock
caused a violent vibration of the whole female frame, from head to foot!
The sight was really disgusting.</p>

<p>In travelling through many parts of Germany we are often surprised at
the paucity of men, and cannot help wondering where they are, or what
they are doing! Women are the universal drudges here!</p>

<p>19. <i>Status quo.</i>—Among all ranks and classes of Society in Germany,
from the prince to the peasant, there is, or there <i>appears</i> to be, a complete
amalgamation, approximation—in fine, an <i>equalization</i> in one thing—<span class="smcap">politeness</span>.
But the approximation goes no farther than the hat, the cap,
and the bow. It would be almost as easy for a Pariar in India, or a Ladrone
in China to break the boundaries of his cast, and rise through the
ranks above him, as for a German of low grade to mount into the circles
of the nobility. Each ascending series is all but hermetically sealed
against the inferior one! What is impossible to be done, is not therefore
attempted—perhaps it is scarcely desired. All this is reversed in England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Here we have but very little reciprocity of external and formal civility
among the different ranks; but the barriers between them are to easily—or
at least so frequently overleaped, that almost every individual has an ardent
wish, and is engaged in a constant struggle to rise above the grade in
which Nature or accident placed him at birth. It is evident that this contrasted
state of things, quite independent of politics, must produce tranquillity,
if not content, in the one country—commotion and even strife in
the other. At the same time it generates industry, energy, and enterprize
in England.</p>

<p>20. <i>Locomotion.</i>—It is passing strange that the mercurial brains of our
French neighbours should never have infused any quicksilver into the heels
of their horses! No. There they go at the old jog-trot of five miles an
hour, over the “long rough road,” which seems as if it had been stretched
out over hill and dale, by some invisible and gigantic apparatus, into a
straight and narrow line, which is as tiresome to the eye of the traveller
as it is to the limbs of the horses. In plodding Germany, however, we
do not expect velocity in man or beast—or that the schnell-post should go
at any other rate than the snail’s pace. In that country time and space
seem to be confounded or amalgamated;—a league signifying an hour,
and an hour a league, the word “<span class="smcap">stunde</span>” (derived no doubt from
“<i>stand</i>”) being applicable to either or both.</p>

<p>There are several reasons, indeed, for the tardiprogression of a German
vehicle, independently of the breed and the build of those animals that
draw it along. <i>First.</i> The German never does anything in a hurry. He
has more time on his hands than any other man. His days are longer—his
nights are longer (though his beds are shorter) than those of an Englishman.
Why then should he hurry over the pleasant journey, or curtail the
salutary range of travelling exercise?—<i>Secondly.</i> A German’s luggage is
twice the size and weight of an Englishman’s, besides the huge crate in
which it is stowed above or behind the carriage. <i>Thirdly.</i> There is an
outlay of time, labour, and expense in frequently cleaning the harness of
the horses—the body, the wheels, or the leather of a carriage. This outlay
is prudently avoided by the German, who trusts to the winds and rains
for disencumbering his harness and eilwagen of some layers of those
weighty and numerous incrustations that have slowly formed on their surface.
<i>Fourthly.</i> There are no Collinge’s patent axletrees in Germany,
which will hold oil for a month; and although the post-master charges
some kreutzers for “grease” at every station, small is the portion of that
lubricating article which reaches the hot and creaking gudgeons of the
ponderous locomotive!</p>

<p>But the primary and fundamental cause of tardiprogression in Germany
may be traced to the roads themselves, which, though much improved in
many places, are still villainously bad, and require the hardest and heaviest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
wood and iron to withstand the tremendous succussions which the vehicle
is destined to experience at every step. Besides, as the German chaussée
marches straight forward over hill and dale, without deigning to wind
round the one, in order to evade the other, so the <span class="smcap">schnell-post</span> must
necessarily go at a snail’s pace to the end of the chapter—or, at all events,
to the end of the journey.</p>

<p>21. <i>The Burschen.</i>—Perhaps no country, except Germany, <i>could</i> generate,
or <i>would</i> tolerate a large class of the rising generation—students
by profession, but demi-ruffians by habit—who are organized in clubs, and
banded in clans, for no other purpose but the violation of all law, order,
decency, and morality! The supreme felicity of the Burschen is to swill
beer, smoke tobacco, and fight duels. If they submit one hour in the
twenty-four to the rule of the professor, they rule him, and tyrannize over
others during the remainder of the day. Most of the hours that can be
spared from duelling, fencing, and dancing, are dedicated to what they
term “<i>renowning</i>”—that is, of working all kinds of mischief—enacting all
sorts of absurdities—attracting everybody’s attention—and earning every
one’s contempt and detestation. The evening and much of the night are
spent in the ale-house, where the summit of the Burschen’s ambition is,
who can drink most beer, smoke most tobacco—and vociferate with the
loudest voice—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Though wine, it is true, be a rarity here.</div>
<div class="verse">We’ll be jolly as gods with tobacco and beer.</div>
<div class="verse indent6">“Vivallerallerallera.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">While bellowing about liberty, justice, honour, and truth, the Burschen
will tyrannize over others with the most despotic sway—break the sword
of justice over the victim’s head—trample on the laws of honour—and
violate the sacred truth!</p>

<p>“Full of lofty unintelligible notions of his own importance—misled by
ludicrously erroneous ideas of honour—the true <span class="smcap">Bursche</span> swaggers and
renowns, choleric raw and overbearing. He measures his own honour by
the number of <i>scandals</i> (duels) he has fought; but never wastes a thought
on what they have been fought for. He does not fight to resent insolence;
but he insults, or takes offence, that he may have a pretext for fighting.
The lecture-rooms are but secondary to the fencing-school. <i>That</i> is his
temple—the rapier is his god—and the “<span class="smcap">comment</span>” (the Burschen laws)
is the Gospel by which he swears.”<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Such is the <span class="smcap">Burschen</span>, or collegiate youth of Germany. The fraternity
itself is called the “<span class="smcap">Landsmannschaften</span>”—a confederation of various
clans for the double purpose of fighting among themselves, and defending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the corps against the Philistines, as the rest of the world is called!
Fortunately for society, this odious freemasonry which is forced on the
student at first, is dropped with the cap, long hair, uncouth coat, and
Jack-boots, the moment he bids adieu to Alma Mater—and he settles
down among his brethren the <span class="smcap">Philistines</span>, discharged from the <span class="smcap">Landsmannschaften</span>,
like an old soldier from the army, with nothing but honorable(?)
scars to remind him of the days of “renowning” and “scandalizing,”
in Gottingen, Jena, Leipzig, or Heidelburg. It is said, but I
doubt the assertion, that this three years’ training in habits the most
objectionable, seldom, if ever, exerts any influence on the citizen in after-life—and
that he becomes as peaceable, civil, and obedient to the laws, as
those who had never set foot within the walls of a university.</p>

<p>Be this <span class="smcap">as it</span> may, it becomes a serious question whether initiation into
the Eleusinian mysteries and eccentric, not to say barbarous, habits of the
Burschen, be conducive to the welfare of British youth? The effects of
English universities are not always thrown off with the cap and gown!
Let parents ponder on the <span class="smcap">Landsmannschaften</span>.</p>

<p>22. <i>German Cookery.</i>—I am not going into a disquisition on continental
cookery in general, nor on German in particular. Man has been characterized
as a “<span class="smcap">cooking animal</span>,” and if refinement in this noble art and
science be a proof of civilization, our Gallic and Saxon neighbours must
stand unrivalled. The New Zealander, who roasts his hog, his dog, and
his prisoner in the same oven, sinks very low on the gastronomic scale—not
on account of his canine or cannibal predilections, but because he cannot
so mystify and transform the original materials of his laboratory—the
genera and species of his animal and vegetable stock—as to defy Orfila
himself to ascertain whether they had been inhabitants of the air, the
earth, or the “waters under the earth.” As I think I have made a small
discovery that may prove of some importance in the cuisine of my native
land, I shall here communicate it, <i>pro bono publico</i>.</p>

<p>In almost all the cities, towns, and even villages of Germany, we find on
the bill of fare certain dishes that are great favourites with <span class="smcap">John Bull</span>—namely,
beef-steaks—mutton-chops—veal cutlets—pork-chops—lamb-chops,
&amp;c. To be sure the titles are not very easily pronounced; but the
kind host is always ready to furnish you with rind-fleisch, schwein-fleisch,
lamms-fleisch, kalbfleisch, or hammelfleisch, without doubt or delay. When
these come on the table, they are so nicely browned, and crusted over with
bread-crumbs, flower, butter and other mysterious compounds, that, except
by the external figure, and the protuberant rib, no discrimination between
the different dishes could possibly be made. Nor will the taste detect
schweins-fleisch from any of the other fleshes. All agree, however, in the
tenderness, flavour, and delicacy of the steaks, chops, and cutlets. Then,
again, they remark, how well the fat is taken off, leaving nothing but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
meat; while the bone comes out as easy and as clean as if it had been
boiled and scraped in a separate vessel! These eulogies attracted my
attention, and I began to examine the chops and steaks accurately. A
very slight dissection demonstrated, beyond a doubt, that all was a composition.
A few further intrusions into the cuisines explained the whole
matter, without difficulty. The cold meat, of every description, is pounded
in a mortar, with pepper, salt, and spices. When wanted, it is pressed
into moulds (like butter) according to the shape required—an old rib or
bone is thrust into one end of the chop—the whole is well covered with
crumbs of bread, flour, or other habiliments—made smoking hot in the
oven—and brought to table as most delicious mutton-chops, veal cutlets,
pork-chops, beef-steaks—or—anything you please to demand.</p>

<p>Do I blame or criticise this ingenious manufacture? Far from it. The
pounded and compounded chops and steaks are better than original ones—are
easy of digestion—require little or no mastication—are savoury to the
taste, and warm to the stomach—and, what is of some consequence, they
are economical, and always ready for dressing at any hour of the day or
night. The only part of the compound to which I object, is the <i>bony-part</i>.
These bones remain in the kitchen, like heir-looms, serving from generation
to generation, as far as I know, and if the cook takes the trouble to
wash them daily, with the spoons’ and forks, my objection vanishes at once.
The above discovery explained an enigma which often puzzled me when
travelling on the Continent—namely, the impossibility of getting cold meat
at a hotel—even a few hours after the most splendid table-d’hôte.</p>

<p>I can have no reason—or at all events no right, to question the taste of
our continental neighbours in the preparation of their food. To German
cookery, German spas, German baths, and German waggons, I owe the
loss of fifteen pounds in weight, and that in a late tour of two months.
But then the lost flesh was London fed—and I gained in strength far more
in proportion than I lost in weight. This may prove a valuable hint to
the race of aldermen, and many others besides.</p>

<p>23. <i>Gallic and German Patriotism compared.</i>—The temperature of a
Frenchman’s patriotism seldom reaches the boiling, or even the fever point,
unless he is, in act or imagination, the aggressor or agitator. It requires
the fuel of pride, ambition, glory, revolution, or conquest, present or
prospective, to keep up the steam of national enthusiasm among our
Gallic neighbours. Not so beyond the Rhine. A German’s patriotism
rises in proportion as “<span class="smcap">Faderland</span>” is borne down by misfortunes, or
trode upon by the foot of the haughty foreigner. The flame of devotion
to country never burns with greater intensity in a German’s breast, than
when it is apparently extinguished by the pressure of the victorious enemy.
Both these propositions are proved by history. Every one knows the
sacrifices which the people of France made in the late war, while Napoleon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
was trampling on the liberties of Europe. Yet, when the tide of his
glory ebbed, and the energies of Germany and other countries carried
forward the contest into the heart of France—the French nation sunk into
apathy, stupor, or indifference. So, on a recent occasion, when the thunder
of British cannon demolished the ramparts of a Syrian despot—a vice-regal
slave-driver—and reverberated from the pyramids to Montmartre,
the flame of patriotism glowed in every Frenchman’s breast, from the
Mediterranean to the Moselle—and already the <span class="smcap">Marsellaise</span> hymn depicted
the <span class="smcap">Eagles</span>, as pluming their wings and wafting their flight over
the Alps and the Rhine—over the Tyber and the Thames! For, although
the word “patriotism” means, in all other languages, the love of natal soil,
yet in the French vocabulary, it signifies the love of revolution at home,
or of conquest and spoliation beyond the limits of France.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The wanton
and threatening insult, though only prospective and intentional, which
she lately held out to Europe, called forth a “<span class="smcap">German Marsellaise</span>,”
tuned to true patriotic principles, and containing no menace—no allusion
to former invasions of France, and capture of her capital. The whole
burthen of the song, and conclusion of each verse, breathed only the firm
resolution to resist aggression, and preserve their “Faderland” independent.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“No, never shall they have it, our free-born German Rhine,</div>
<div class="verse">Till deep beneath its surges, our last man’s bones recline!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>German patriotism, in the long run, will prove superior to Gallic ambition.
The love of country is a nobler and safer passion than the love
of conquest.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>The French tell us that the English are detested on the Continent—but
to adduce any reason for this, would be quite unlike a Frenchman—whose
assertion needs not the vulgar auxiliary of proof. The only plausible
cause which he might urge for this anti-Britannic hatred, is the fact that
the English assisted the continental nations to drive the French back over
the Rhine, and up to the Boulevards—hence the detestation of Germany,
Russia, Spain, &amp;c. against England! This is quite the Gallic style of
ratiocination.</p>

<p>24. <i>Prisons.</i>—There would seem to be two, if not more, kinds of
liberty—political and personal; or national and individual. They do not
always run parallel. When our Gallic neighbours placed the <span class="smcap">Cap of
Liberty</span> on the head of a <span class="smcap">Courtezan</span>, and worshipped her as a <span class="smcap">Goddess</span>,
the prisons were overflowing, and most of the inmates lost their caps—in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
which their heads happened to be at the time! No one will contend that
Germany is overburthened with political liberty—but I believe that the
proportion of out-door to in-door prisoners there, is as great as in this
country. To say the truth there are not many temptations to take up free
quarters within the walls of a German prison—for although <span class="smcap">Howard</span>, that
great practical reformer of “proved,” that is to say, <i>approved</i> abuses, was
there; yet the hard labour, low fare, bastinado for men, and whip for
women, afford little encouragement to transgression of the laws. To
the honour of Austria be it said, that the functionaries are strictly enjoined
to apply the whip and bastinado, with all due regard to the <i>moral feelings</i>
of the prisoners, and with the most scrupulous attention to the forms and
ceremonies prescribed for those occasions!</p>

<p>In respect to food, the following is the Austrian dietary. “The prisoner
has one pound and a half of bread <i>per diem</i>—a farinaceous dish with milk
thrice a week—and on Sundays a soup, with a quarter of a pound of
meat, and the farinaceous dish again.” <i>Hawkins.</i> This, it must be confessed,
is meagre fare; but <i>half</i> of what the prisoner can earn, <i>beyond his
daily task</i>, is given to him for the purchase of additional comforts.</p>

<p>Instruction, both religious and lay, is provided by the state—consisting
of reading and sometimes of arithmetic—but not <i>writing</i>, as that might
lead to correspondence not entirely composed of love-letters or letters of
love! It is clear, indeed, that the Emperor of Austria (though himself a
<span class="smcap">Papist</span>) has no great faith in the dogma of a <span class="smcap">Pope</span>—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">At all events, Prince Metternich has not recommended his master to follow

<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Waft a <i>sigh</i> from Indus to the Pole.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Nevertheless there are many good points about German prison-discipline.
The classification of the prisoners—the separation of the juvenile from the
hardened offenders—the law of rendering labour the only means of procuring
anything like comfortable diet—the regularity of religious instruction
and duties—the laudable exertion of Government to reinstate the
liberated and punished prisoner in the social position previously occupied—not
forgetting the humane injunction never to hurt the <i>feelings</i> of the
flogged—are all worthy of praise and imitation.</p>

<p>25. <i>Beds and Bed-rooms.</i>—A German sleeping-room presents a real
paradox—beds that are at once plural and singular—plural in number, but
singular in office. One would suppose that all the men in that country
were monks, and all the women nuns. You look in vain for the large and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
comfortable bed, on which John Bull and his spouse are accustomed to
repose when at home. Nothing of the kind will you see here! From the
moment that a married couple set foot on the Continent, the wife is divorced,
if not “<i>a mensa</i>” at least “<i>a thoro</i>.” I have said that the German
beds are <i>singular</i>. They are so in every sense of the word! In other
countries, they are designed to promote rest and sleep. In this they act
like strong coffee or green tea taken at ten o’clock. In a German bed, the
two extremities of the victim are “perched up aloft,” while the body is
“under hatches.” The only personage who can attain anything like horizontality
in these cribs, is the corporation gourmand after a good eight
o’clock table-d’hôte. If he turn in, or rather turn <i>over</i> on his face, with
his feet on the taffrail, and his stomach stowed in midships, he will be able
to bring his head, his spine, and his heels into something approaching a
right line. In this position he will have the great advantage of sleeping
on his supper, and thus evading the pressure of the night-mare. When
the woolsack is laid over the traveller’s body, the whole resembles the old
moon in the lap of the new.</p>

<p>It is very fortunate for John and Jane Bull that before they sojourn
long in Germany their travelling constitutions will have begun, like new
clothes, to suit them—and, which is of greater consequence, they will have
got rid of the most inconvenient article, by far, of their luggage—(and
that is saying a good deal, when a lady’s baggage is in transit)—namely
the—idea of <span class="smcap">comfort</span>—an article which even the douanier never searches
for, as being not only out of his beat, but out of his mother tongue!</p>

<p>Many circumstances had, long ago, impressed me with a high sense of
the value of a <span class="smcap">travelling constitution</span>, as a kind of Mackintosh against
“skiey influences;” but none more so than an occasional glimpse at the
mysteries of the laundry. If a traveller happens to forget some valuable
article at his hotel, and hastens back to his chamber about mid-day, he will
be rather surprized to find the bed-linen on the floor, nicely sprinkled with
water, preparatory to a squeeze under a high-pressure engine, which renders
it of a glossy smoothness, and diffuses the watery element so equally,
that it feels delightfully cool to the next—and even to the tenth tenant
of the caravansera! I fear that this is often the case nearer home, and
where there is no “<i>travelling constitution</i>” to resist the vapour-bath of exhalent
sheets in our foggy and cold atmosphere! The contracts between
masters and chamber-maids for the supply of damp linen to hotels, are too
often contracts for the supply of coughs, consumptions, and rheumatisms
to travellers—greatly to the advantage of doctors, druggists, and undertakers
afterwards!</p>

<p>Tourists who can afford space for leather sheets among their luggage,
should take these useful articles with them, as there are more maladies than
colds and rheumatisms <i>contracted</i> in caravanseras, and for which there is
no provision made in the <i>contract</i> between host and passenger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>It must be acknowledged, however, that, of late years considerable improvements
have taken place in the bedding line. In several parts of Germany,
in the Autumn of 1840, we found very comfortable mattresses,
blankets, coverlets, and sheets, to our no small joy and surprize.</p>

<p>26. <i>German Stove</i> versus <i>English Chimney</i>.—That a room heated by
invisible caloric—with an atmosphere stagnant as the dead sea, humid as a
Scotch mist, and odoriferous as a slaughter-house—should prove more
congenial to the lungs of persons in the first or last stage of consumption,
than an apartment with a blazing fire at one end, a large column of hot
air rushing up the chimney, and a thousand tiny streams of cold air stealing
in through the chinks and crevices of doors and windows, I do not, for
a moment, deny. But, that the general balance of salubrity is on the
side of the German stove, and against the English fire-place, I very much
doubt. I admit that the air of an English room, heated by fire, is frequently
changing the degree of its temperature, not only as a whole, but
in different parts of the same chamber. This is the alpha and omega of
Continental objections to the English plan—and it would not be difficult
to show that this variability of heat, so much complained of, is a powerful
preservative against atmospheric disorders in general. Nothing is more certain
than that the most effectual way of counteracting the effects of sudden
changes in the temperature of the air around us, is to <i>habituate</i> ourselves
to these vicissitudes. It is in this way, that daily sponging of the face,
throat, and other exposed parts of the body, first with hot, and then immediately
with cold water, generally prevents face-aches, ear-aches, tooth-aches,
and catarrhs, by habituating those parts to changes of temperature. And it
is on this principle, that a person who has been for some time in an English
room, where variations prevail, goes out into the open air afterwards, with
far less risk than he who has been for an equal time in an actual sudatorium,
at a high and unvarying range of temperature. But let us look a
little more closely into the affair. In the room heated by a German stove
and consequently where there cannot be a free ventilation, every individual
is breathing the identical air that has circulated through the lungs of every
other individual in the same place—through the air-cells of the scrofulous,
the scorbutic, the asthmatic, the consumptive, &amp;c.—air that is not
only deprived of its oxygen, but loaded with animal effluvia of a very
questionable character! Add to these the malodorous essence of tobacco,
much of which must drip down the throat, as well as into the receptacle
below the bowl of the pipe, during the day, to be exhaled in <i>poisonous</i>
gases through the rooms at night! All must have experienced the debilitating
effects of disoxygenated air in crowded rooms, even where there
were various facilities of ingress and egress for the breath of Heaven. But
where these facilities are wanting, the depression of the vital energies is
indescribable. In short, I am of opinion that nothing can compensate for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the ventilation produced by the English chimney. Those who stand or sit
near a partially opened door, or a broken pane of glass, may catch cold, or
face-ache, or rheumatism, it is true; but if I am to die or to suffer from
atmospheric influence, let me do so in pure, rather than in mephitic air!</p>

<p>I have grounded these reasonings on salubrity alone—leaving <i>comfort</i>
out of the question—as indeed it must be round the German stove! Why,
the very sight of a cheerful fire in a Winter evening, is worth a German
stove with the table-d’hôte thrown into the bargain! In a good fire we
have company, conversation, and even meditation. I do not wonder that
the Persees adore fire, as an emanation from the sun itself. I much
doubt whether the Egyptians would have worshipped a German stove, even
when they were so over-godly as to deify cats and crocodiles! But, to
give the devil his due, the German stove is not without some good qualities.
It is cheap—it does not set fire to ladies’ dresses—nor cause chilblains
by scorching the fingers and toes in frosty weather. But as a drawback
upon these negative good qualities, it renders the Germans a race of
hot-house plants, who shiver in the blast whenever they issue from their
vapour-baths, and are infinitely more liable to take cold than if they had
come from an English room.</p>

<p>The introduction into this country of the <span class="smcap">Anglo-Germanic</span> stove—that
unsightly and unsocial laboratory of sulphur and suffocation—will not, I
think, succeed. It is bad enough in Germany, where the Dutch tiles with
which it is covered, emit no bad smell, and have a comparatively light and
cheerful appearance; but here the hybrid iron mass—that dark lantern,
“cui lumen ademptum”—is positively a nuisance. It may be borne, and
even prove useful, in large halls, where there are constant currents of
cool air. In a sitting-room or other chamber, it is very offensive—at least
to my senses, from its metallic and sulphurous emanations. I had rather
pitch my tent in the crater of Vesuvius, the valley of Solfatera, or the
hut of a charbonnier in the Maremma, than in the vicinity of that sable
distillery of “Northumberland diamonds,” from which every ray of light
has been previously extracted by the gasometer.</p>

<p>27. <i>Verlobung, or betrothing.</i>—The German system of affiance appears
to me to be a long courtship, and “something more.” It is a kind of
“little-go,” or ante-marriage contract, attended with form, ceremony, and
sequences. The affianced pair send out their cards bound together in the
silken bonds of Hymen, in perspective—are waited on and congratulated
by their friends,—are always invited together to parties, where they sit
next each other at table, engross each other’s conversation, and appear like—or
rather <i>unlike</i>, man and wife. At page 24 of this volume, I ventured
some observations on the danger and the miseries that often attend on
affiances, or long-promised marriages. Notwithstanding the approval of
Mrs. Jameson, I still hold my opinion. That lady indeed, is not blind to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
some of the consequences of the verlobung. One of them will be sufficient.
“As the bridegroom is expected to devote every leisure moment
to the society of his betrothed—as he attends her to all public places—as
they are invariably seated next each other,—<i>they have time to become
tolerably tired of each others’ society before marriage, and have nothing left
to say</i>.” This is a charming prospect for matrimony! The soft looks, the
fine speeches, the glowing sentiments, nay even the pretty riens, are all
expended during the protracted affiance, and when, at last, the knot is tied
indissolubly, the gallant gay lothario is, as Rosalind says—“gravelled for
lack of matter.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Jameson says that this long state of probation enables the
parties to study well their respective characters, and detect failings and
faults which a short courtship would be apt to over-look. Now the affiance
is either binding or not binding. If the latter, of what use is it? If
the <i>former</i>, it is small consolation to the bride or bridegroom to ascertain
the causes of future misery before even Hymen lights his torch! But who
is unaware that courtship is a kind of warfare, in which the belligerents
take good care to mask their weak points and magnify their strong positions.
The Germans themselves, indeed, have an adage that runs in little accordance
with the tedious <span class="smcap">verlobung</span>.</p>

<p>28. <i>March of Population.</i>—Nothing exhibits a greater contrast between
England and the Continent than the progress of population. I believe it
goes on at least three times as fast in the British Isles as in France and
Germany. Many causes may be assigned for this disproportion. The
immense outlet for redundant population in our colonies—the prodigious
extent of our commerce and manufactures—the early period of marriage,
especially in Ireland—these are among the chief causes of the rail-road
speed at which the multiplication of mankind goes on in this country. On
the Continent, it is just the reverse. The pace of population there is quite
“<i>a la schnell-post</i>.” But lest this degree of velocity should endanger the
state waggon, government (in many parts of Germany) has affixed a drag
to the wheels, in the shape of a law prohibiting matrimony, unless the
high contracting parties can produce proof of their possessing ways and
means for supporting themselves and families. If this regulation obtained
in Great Britain, it would stop one half of the marriages in Scotland, two-thirds
of those in England, and nine-tenths of those in Ireland. Here is
a hint for the Poor Law Commissioners, that may induce them to bring a
Bill into Parliament for the prevention of imprudent marriages, which
would be more effectual in checking pauperism than the terrors of the
workhouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>But, when we consider that colonization and commerce carry off an immense
redundancy of British population, how are we to account for the
<i>permanent</i> or domiciliated population of these islands increasing so much
more rapidly than that of the Continent, where the safety-valves are of
such narrow dimensions? There are some causes of these different rates
of progression, which are little known in this country; but the chief
cause must be the greater degree of prudence exercised by the people of
France and Germany than by the people of Great Britain.</p>

<p>29. <i>Poetry.</i>—The transition from population to poetry is not so abrupt
as might at first appear; for although we may have population without
poetry, we shall rarely have poetry without population. Looking at the
<i>words</i> of the German language, a stranger to that language would be apt
to conclude that it must be as difficult to mould them into music or poetry,
as to convert hob-nails into ivory teeth—the bristles of a boar into the
ermine of a judge—or the rocks of Iona into columns of crystal. Yet
nothing would be a more erroneous prejudice than this conclusion. The
German, like the English language, is so rich in <i>synonimes</i>, as to afford every
facility for the intonations of the musician, and variety of expression of
the poet. The poverty of the French language in this respect, presents a
remarkable contrast to the German and English. French poetry must
have the jingle of rhyme to make it bearable by the ear. A French poem
in blank verse, would be like a monkey striding along on huge stilts,
exciting roars of laughter from the spectators. But this poverty in synonims,
renders the French language more precise, and the individual words
less equivocal than in any other. Hence its universal advantages in diplomatic
communications, where the synonims of other tongues would give
rise to perpetual ambiguity and quibble.</p>

<p>A curious, not to say ludicrous, attempt has lately been made by an
American author to transplant the poetry of Goethe and Schiller into
English by <i>literal</i> translation, the said author maintaining that poetry <i>will</i>
be poetry <i>still</i>; and that the more close and servile the traduction, the
better will the spirit of the original poetry be preserved! The following
rather favourable specimen of this attempt to clothe German ideas in
English words, is quite a “curiosity of literature,” and worth preserving.</p>

they were training a band of serpents to hiss him out of the valley, should he ever re-enter

from the Duke of Nassau—unless it be such a one as two of his brethren (Drs. Downey

and <i>bussel</i>-rending, I never beheld in any other country, except the Celestial

<p><a name="Footnote_25" id="Footnote_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> It must, at the same time, be confessed that, in Germany, all this quietude, order,
and decorum, <i>appear</i> to be the result of a spontaneous disposition of the people. There
is no <i>visible</i> governing or directing power—no policemen at the corner of every street,
or gens-d’armes watching their movements! All is <i>seemingly</i> automatic. Yet there
must be some strong arm behind the scene—much careful pre-arrangement and organization
to effect this tranquillity and regularity. We see a steam-carriage fly along a
rail-road, without any outward or visible impelling power; but what complicated
machinery is stowed inside? What vast labour was expended before the automaton
started on the road! So it may be with Germany.</p>

more easily condemned by prejudice than convicted by argument. I confess that I was
fairly beaten out of the field by a German philosopher, while discussing the point.
<i>First</i>, he urged the antiquity of the practice—the Romans having public baths for both
sexes indiscriminately, on a most magnificent scale. The larger the bath, however, the
less the objection, and <i>vice versa</i>, which he acknowledged. <i>Secondly</i>, he asked me what
there was in the element <i>water</i>, to render promiscuous assemblages of the sexes more
indelicate than in the element air? I answered that in the latter element the people
were dressed. Dressed! he exclaimed. Why in the <i>bath</i> they are closely clothed from
the chin to the soles of the feet; while in the <i>ball-room</i> the ladies exclude dress from
every spot which they dare expose without outraging decency! There was no denying
this. He added that, it was surely as unobjectionable for invalids of both sexes to walk
and wade about in the bath, during the open day, as for people in high health to waltz
about in crowded assemblies, during the middle of the night. On observing that the
English were shocked at the practice of bathing promiscuously, because their eyes were
unaccustomed to the sight; he replied, “exactly so—and the Germans, who are accustomed to
it, feel nothing at all on the occasion.” The only objection on which I was obliged
to fall back, was the loss of friction and shampooing in the bath—a drawback which
the German admitted as unavoidable in public baths, but which, he maintained, was, in
some degree, compensated for by the pleasure of conversation and society.</p>

Dr. Ebell, should have been led into the monstrous error of imagining that the torrent
of the Tamina had, in the course of ages, hollowed out of the marble rock this profound
bed for itself. We might just as well suppose, that the bed of the Mediterranean had
been scooped out by the waters of the Hellespont, in their way from the Black Sea to
the Atlantic. The mountain was rent by some convulsion of Nature, and apparently
from below upwards, as the breadth, at the bed of the Tamina, is far broader than the

Mrs. Boddington—a work eulogised to the skies in the Edinburgh Review, and its
author represented (and, I understand, deservedly) as a lady of very superior talents
and strict veracity. After some slight notice of the Bath-house, Mrs. B. proceeds
thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Behind rolls the stormy Tamina, hemmed in at one side by the dark Bath-house and
the impending cliffs, while, on the other, a giant wall of perpendicular rock, starting up
daringly, and shutting out the world—almost the light of Heaven—closes up the scene.
Our guide proposed that we should visit the mineral springs that boil up from the depth
of an awful cavern, several hundred paces from the Bath-house. A bridge, thrown from
rock to rock, crosses the flood, and a narrow ledge of planks, fixed, I know not how,
against the side of the rock, and suspended over the fierce torrent, leads through a long
dark chasm to the source. I ventured but a little way; for, when I found myself on the
terrifying shelf, without the slightest ballustrade, and felt it slippery, from the continual
spray, and saw nothing between us and the yawning gulf, to which darkness, thickening
at every step, gave increased horror, I made a few rapid reflections on foolhardiness,
and retreated.”</p>

They were discovered in the 12th century, by two chasseurs from the neighbouring

time they could only descend to these baths by means of ropes; but at length human
ingenuity formed zig-zags along the rocks. As if every thing relating to these waters
should partake of the wonderful, it may be mentioned that they begin to flow in May,
when the Summer is approaching—are at their acmé when the skies are fervid and the
land parched with thirst, yielding 1500 pints of water every minute—and cease entirely

handsome buildings, a mile in length, with a magnificent Cursaal in the centre, stretches
along the Lahn, while new edifices are fast rising on the other side of the river.
Beautiful promenades are formed all along this line, between the houses and the Lahn,
while two bands of music play several hours in the day. The view from the highest

down, with incredible labour, through a bed of schistus and other rock, on the opposite
side of the Lahn, a spring boiled up with a force equal to that of the Sprudel, and at a
temperature of 168° of Fahrenheit! The inundation, by infiltration, from the Lahn,
overpowered the efforts of the workmen, and the enterprize was abandoned. Various
fragments of masonry and wood were found in this place, rendering it probable that, at
some remote period—perhaps in the time of the Romans, there was a thermal fountain
in this place. The water is still seen boiling up from the bed of the river at this place,
and, on immersing my thermometer in the water of the Lahn there, the mercury stood
at 104°.</p>

which medicinal waters present, and requires the most vigilant attention. I have
not the least doubt that it is owing to the want of light aperient alteratives taken over
night, by which the biliary and other glandular secretions are kept in a state of activity,

<p>The ancient history of <i>Carlsbad</i> is interesting: it shews the powers of mendacious
tradition. There is a certain mountain on the left bank of the Teple, termed
<i>Hirschensprung</i> [Spring of the stag], which carries in its very name a wondrous tale.</p>

<p>As early as the middle of the fourteenth century, Charles IV. Emperor of Germany,
and King of Bohemia, was pursuing a stag, and the animal, pressed closely by the
hounds, ascended that lofty mountain. The huntsmen, unable to follow, on account of
the steepness of the ascent, were returning by the bank of the river, supposing they
had lost their game, when—imagine their surprise—they heard the cries of the scalded
animal on the opposite side. The cause was easily explained. In the last despairing
hope of escape, the animal had made a leap, from the top of the Hirschensprung,
over the Teple; and had fallen, quite accidentally, into the boiling, bubbling Sprudel.
The distance, as the crow flies, may be a mile, perhaps a mile and a half (more or
less), a difference in tradition’s eye, of no importance. Thus the stag was found, and
the Sprudel discovered, simultaneously. Tradition’s stories are always complete. King
Charles happened to have a bad leg, for which (of course) the exercise of hunting was
beneficial; he happened to try the waters, and happened to get well. The place henceforth
assumed his name, Carlsbad (Charles’ bath), and rose by degrees to the importance
it now possesses.</p>

it is reckoned prodigious by the <span class="smcap">Homœopath</span>, who indeed, considers that the surplus
waters which flow from the Sprudel into the Teple, are quite sufficient to impregnate
the stream of the Elbe at Hamburgh abundantly for all medicinal purposes. M.
Creutzburg calculates that, in the course of a season at Carlsbad, during which he
drank 404 goblets of the waters, there were 3¼ grains of hydriodate of soda, in that
quantity. The quantity of carbonic acid gas in the pint is about 12 cubic inches.</p>

a temperature as high as that of the Sprudel; but I believe it is seldom used. The
Schlossbrunnen, much higher up the hill, is the least hot of all—and the Marktbrunnen,
near the Muhlbrunn, is next to it in temperature. It exhales some odour of sulphur.</p>

<p class="center"><a name="Footnote_71" id="Footnote_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71"><span class="label">[71]</span></a> <i>Note from Mr. Spitta.</i></p>

<p>I brought home one of the pretty stamps, made of Sprudelstein; and had the
cruelty to break it up for chemical examination. I found it to be composed, as stalactites
in all parts of the world are, of the earthy carbonates; which, originally held in
solution by carbonic acid gas, are precipitated on its escape. The Sprudel contains a
very small quantity of carbonic acid, only sufficient, as Beecher has observed, to keep
its earthy carbonates in solution. As the water approaches the exit of the cauldron,
and the gas ceases to be under pressure, it resumes its wonted elasticity, passes quietly
off with the vapour which issues from the boiler, and leaves its irony carbonates, sticking
to the edge of the reservoir. Carbonate of lime is the main ingredient of the Sprudelstein—it
contains besides, carbonate of magnesia and iron; to the latter, its reddish-brown
colour is to be attributed. There is a portion of iron also, as peroxyde; and
minute traces of one or two other substances. With regard to the incrustations: they
are nothing more nor less than <i>petrifactions</i> (as they are called), made exactly in the
same manner as other petrifactions, by the deposition of the <i>earthy carbonates</i>. The
difference in colour from other petrifactions arises from the difference in the composition
of the Sprudel water and the water in other parts, where the <i>white</i> incrustations are
formed. The Sprudel contains a small quantity of the <i>carbonate of iron</i>. This is deposited
with the carbonates of lime and magnesia; and hence the brown colour.</p>

fluides elaborés par les divers organs secretoires du corps humain.”—<span class="smcap">De Carro.</span></p>

<p>It must be confessed that the idea of daily ingurgitating such lots of <i>secretions</i> from
some “great unknown” animal in the bowels of the earth, is not a very comfortable one,
and requires a stouter <i>stomach</i> than that which is necessary for the digestion of the
bear’s broth at Wisbaden. There is one consolation, that the whole is a dream; since
there is just as much proof or probability of the Spas of Germany being a <i>secretion</i>
from a living animal, as that the German Ocean is a secretion from Neptune or Amphitrite.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_73" id="Footnote_73"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73"><span class="label">[73]</span></a> The remarkable influence of mind over matter, and hope over both, was exemplified
in 1839, in the person of Surgeon Fraser, of the Bombay establishment. Being reduced
almost to a skeleton by a disease, the nature of which could not be ascertained, he
happened to see my review of Dr. Granville’s book, and immediately determined to
travel <i>over-land</i> to Carlsbad. He embarked in a steamer for Suez—thence was carried
in a litter between two camels across the Desert—embarked again at Alexandria for
Constantinople—thence through the Black Sea up the Danube, and on to Carlsbad, all
this journey being sustained by hope, aided by “change of air.” At Carlsbad the waters
were eagerly taken; but alas! were found to do no good! He lost confidence in them,
and proceeded to Marienbad in a litter. He died two days after his arrival there, and
left his bones in Bohemia! There is little doubt that had he travelled on, instead of
stopping at Carlsbad, he might have reached his native mountains in the Highlands.</p>

<p>On dissection the disease was found to be in the mesenteric glands.</p>

Teplitz, as to the necessity or propriety of having the process of bleeding and bathing

the doctors, however, ratted, and declared that the practice of cupping was seldom

out of the bath, and without any flow of blood into the water. The practice is now,

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
